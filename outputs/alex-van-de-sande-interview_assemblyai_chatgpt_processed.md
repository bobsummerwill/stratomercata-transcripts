**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] What's going on everybody?
[00:03] Alex, I sent you an invite to speak and co-host.
[00:06] If you have any questions, just let me know.
[00:08] You can DM me.
[00:10] Good to see the faces piling in.
[00:12] Got a lot of good questions here.
[00:14] Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:17] Here.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:18] There we go.
[00:19] Alex, good to have you here, man.
[00:21] Appreciate it.
[00:22] If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions, just feel free to raise your hand.
[00:26] Kind of a bit like underwater-y.
[00:28] Is Victor on here?
[00:30] No Victor.
[00:31] Okay, let me see.
[00:32] Give us a few moments, guys.
[00:34] Trying to set this up.
[00:35] Appreciate your patience.
[00:37] Ah, technology.
[00:38] Cartoons, you want to come up?
[00:40] I'll invite you.
[00:41] Even if you're just on the panel, you don't gotta speak.
[00:43] You were here for episode zero, so...

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:45] But you got you mechanical.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:47] I wish my phone wasn't so dumb.
[00:49] I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:51] You should sing again.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:52] Who said that?
[00:53] Alex?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:54] Hey, you should play some live music.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:56] I was playing some classical music, but yeah, I don't know.
[00:59] It's good to have you on here.
[01:01] I'm glad the mic's all working out now.
[01:03] I really appreciate you jumping on.
[01:05] It's been an interesting six months for sure.
[01:07] So really I just want to kind of pick your brain a bit about the past.
[01:10] Honestly, more than just Mist Coin in general, but really just how you got all started with the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot.
[01:15] So like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum and what was your kind of first initial reaction to it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:20] Sure.
[01:21] I have to say, my wife thinks it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now.
[01:26] So I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's fun.
[01:29] So I started being interested in Bitcoin around 2012.
[01:33] That feels like a long time ago.
[01:35] It feels like the early days, but for me I already felt like, oh God, I missed it already.
[01:39] Talking about Bitcoin on The Good Wife on live TV.
[01:42] I was like, oh no, it used to be under a dollar, now it's like $10.
[01:45] Damn, I so missed Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:47] Right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:48] That's too bad.
[01:49] I even remember I posted something on the forum saying, "Oh no, I tried buying Bitcoin at $5. It was so hard."
[01:54] And then someone tipped me like five Bitcoin on Reddit saying, "Hey, here's your five dollars worth of Bitcoin."
[01:59] And it was like back then, I don't know, probably a full Bitcoin, right?
[02:02] Like Bitcoin was $5 back then.
[02:04] So that was those early days.
[02:06] Again, didn't feel poor yet.
[02:08] And then I started paying attention because I felt that I knew something bigger would come for Bitcoin.
[02:12] And I just started following all sorts of projects like Colored Coin and Mastercoin, things like that, until I found Ethereum.
[02:18] And I was, wow.
[02:19] I was so blown away and captivated that I couldn't think of anything else.
[02:23] And people were still very active on the Reddit.
[02:25] Like Vitalik would answer questions personally.
[02:27] And then I just started helping out on the forum, on the Reddit.
[02:30] I'm a designer, I'm not a coder.
[02:32] So I thought, hey, there are enough coders here, maybe they need a designer.
[02:36] And then someone would ask something for a presentation they could give them.
[02:39] And then by the time that the presale rolled around, they started having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list.
[02:44] So that's how I started working with some crazy people.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:47] So you did not expect to be so heavily involved and become the pioneer that you did.
[02:51] You were just kind of jumping in and interested in this new opportunity, really?
[02:55] You didn't expect it to blow up like this?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:57] I certainly didn't expect it to—sort of yes and no.
[03:00] Because I felt it back then.
[03:02] It seemed very obvious that it was going to be a big thing.
[03:05] And I was like, I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this.
[03:09] I felt like telling everybody I knew, "Can't you see?"

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:11] Look at this.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:12] This is crazy.
[03:13] It's like the blockchain but with a computer inside.
[03:15] And people were like, people are actually this crazy?
[03:18] I was a founder of a company back then.
[03:20] I was doing an iPhone app, sort of like Instagram but for fashionistas.
[03:24] And I had raised money, but the app wasn't going anywhere.
[03:27] And I realized that I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app.
[03:31] I was just thinking about Ethereum all the time.
[03:33] And then I told my friends that I wanted to leave this.
[03:36] They were like, "Are you leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old that's going to pay you in makeup money that he invented?"
[03:42] I was like, "Yeah, sure. That feels like a great idea."

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:45] Yeah, that's crazy, man.
[03:47] That's honestly—I mean, just your...

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:49] You...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:50] You know, your belief in what this could turn out to be ended up leading you to such success and being a pioneer in this space.
[03:56] So when we talked before in the past, you told me you kind of helped assemble the Mist Wallet development team.
[04:01] You explained you were part of the hiring and you brought Fabian on board.
[04:04] How did you go about getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team, and what made you so confident in his abilities?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:09] So when I started working, the first person I started talking about working with was Gavin Wood.
[04:13] Gavin Wood was the one who sort of introduced me to the idea of making a browser.
[04:17] I would say that really, the way I got to work with Ethereum was I downloaded what was the latest client, the C++ client, and then it was called AlethZero.
[04:25] And if you ever— you should try to Google how that looked like, because it felt like the command of an Airbus.
[04:30] Lots of small windows showing all sorts of buttons and things you had to push.
[04:34] It was super complex.
[04:35] But I still looked at it and said, "Whoa, this is like a fantastic test gap. I wish it was simpler to use."
[04:40] And I designed something which was very similar to what the Mist Wallet looked like.
[04:44] And then I was very proud showing that to Gav.
[04:46] And he called me to have a Skype call.
[04:48] And then he told me, "Look, I thought I had basically re-transformed the whole thing."
[04:52] And he told me, "No, I think you're not going far enough. I think you're not thinking big enough about this."
[04:56] I was like, "Look, I took this thing that was weird. I made it something that looks usable. It looks like a blockchain in which—"
[05:01] "That's what it is, right? It's a blockchain, but instead of sending coins, you send contracts and you execute stuff."
[05:06] And he was like, "No, this is going to be the foundation of a new web, and we are calling this Web3."
[05:11] "There's going to be a browser and there's going to be client interfaces. You're going to download it via Torrent or via Swarm."
[05:16] "You're going to talk to people directly via P2P. It's going to replace the Internet browser as you know it."
[05:21] "It's going to be better than Onion. Now you're going to download apps directly from your peers."
[05:26] "So apps would never go offline."
[05:28] And I was like, "Wow, this is crazy. I want to be a part of this."
