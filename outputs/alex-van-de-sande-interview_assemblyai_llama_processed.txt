**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] What's going on everybody?
[00:01] Alex, I sent you an invite to speak and co-host.
[00:02] If you have any questions, just let me know.
[00:03] You can DM me.
[00:04] Good to see the faces piling in.
[00:05] Got a lot of good questions here.
[00:06] Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:07] Here.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:08] There we go.
[00:09] Alex, good to have you here, man.
[00:10] Appreciate it.
[00:11] If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions, just feel free to raise your hand.
[00:12] Kind of like underwater, it is.
[00:13] Is Victor on here?
[00:14] No Victor.
[00:15] Okay, let me see.
[00:16] Give us a few moments, guys.
[00:17] Trying to set this up.
[00:18] Appreciate your patience.
[00:19] Ah, technology, cartoons.
[00:20] You want to come up?
[00:21] I'll invite you.
[00:22] Even if you're just on the panel, you don't gotta speak.
[00:23] You were here for episode zero, so...

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:24] But you got you mechanical.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:25] I wish my phone wasn't so dumb.
[00:26] I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:27] You should sing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:28] Who's who said that?
[00:29] Alex.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:30] Hey, you should play some live music.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:31] I was playing some classical music, but yeah, I don't know.
[00:32] It's good to have you on here.
[00:33] I'm glad the mic's all working out now.
[00:34] I really appreciate you jumping on.
[00:35] It's been an interesting six months for sure.
[00:36] So really I just want to kind of just pick your brain a bit about, about the past.
[00:37] Honestly, like more than just, you know, Mist Coin in general, but really just like how you got all started with, you know, the Ethereum foundation and whatnot.
[00:38] So like when did you actually hear about Ethereum and what was your kind of first initial reaction to it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:39] Sure.
[00:40] I, I have to say my wife thinks it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now.
[00:41] So I find it, I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's fun.
[00:42] So I, I think.
[00:43] So I started being interested in, I think Bitcoin around 2012.
[00:44] So that was in like, it feels like a long time ago.
[00:45] It feels like the early days, but for me, I already felt like, oh God, I missed it already.
[00:46] Talking about Bitcoin on The Good Wife on live TV.
[00:47] I was like, oh no, but like he used to be under a dollar, now it's like $10.
[00:48] Damn, I so missed Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:49] Right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:50] That's too bad.
[00:51] I even remember like I posted something on the forum saying, oh no, I tried buying Bitcoin at $5.
[00:52] I paid.
[00:53] It was so hard.
[00:54] And then someone simply like, I think tipped me like five Bitcoin on Reddit.
[00:55] Saying, hey, here's your five-dollar worth of Bitcoin.
[00:56] And it was like back then, I don't know, like probably a full Bitcoin, right?
[00:57] Like, Bitcoin was $5 back then.
[00:58] So that was that, that was those early days, huh?
[00:59] Again, didn't feel poorly.
[01:00] And then I started paying attention because I felt that I knew someone bigger would come for Bitcoin.
[01:01] And I just started following all sorts of projects like colored coin and Mastercoin, things like that, until I found Ethereum.
[01:02] And I was, wow.
[01:03] I was so blown away and captivated that I couldn't think of anything else.
[01:04] And people were still very active on the Reddit.
[01:05] Like Vitalik would answer questions personally.
[01:06] And then I just started helping out on the forum on the Reddit.
[01:07] I'm a designer, I'm not a coder.
[01:08] So I thought, hey, like, there are enough coders here, maybe they need a designer.
[01:09] And then someone would ask something for a presentation they could give them.
[01:10] And then by the time that the pre-sale rolled around, they started having cash hiring people, and I was on the list.
[01:11] So that's how I got, I started working with some crazy people.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:12] So you did not like, expect to be so heavily involved and become the pioneer that you did.
[01:13] You were just kind of jumping in and, you know, interested in this new opportunity.
[01:14] Really?
[01:15] You didn't expect it to blow up like this?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:16] I certainly didn't expect it to, like, sort of yes and no.
[01:17] Because I felt it back then.
[01:18] It was, it seemed very obvious that it was going to be a big thing.
[01:19] And I was like, I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this.
[01:20] I was like, can't I, I felt like telling everybody I knew.
[01:21] Can't you see?
[01:22] This is, this is crazy.
[01:23] It's like the blockchain but with a computer inside.
[01:24] And people were like, people are actually as crazy.
[01:25] Like I, I, I was a founder of a company back then.
[01:26] I was doing like an iPhone app, sort of like Instagram but for fashionistas.
[01:27] And I had raised money with like, but the app wasn't going anywhere.
[01:28] And I realized that I wasn't, I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app.
[01:29] I was just thinking about it here all the time.
[01:30] And then I told my friends that I wanted to leave this.
[01:31] They were like, are you like leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old that's going to pay you in like makeup money that he invented?
[01:32] I was like, yeah, sure, that feels like a great idea.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:33] Yeah, that's crazy, man.
[01:34] That's honestly, I mean, just your belief in, in what this could turn out to be, ended up leading you to such, you know, success and a pie, you know, being a pioneer in this space.
[01:35] So when we talked before in the past, you told me you kind of helped assemble the Mist Wallet development team.
[01:36] You explained you were part of like the hiring and you brought Fabian on board.
[01:37] How did you go about like getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team, and what made you so confident in his abilities?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:38] So when I started working, so I, the first person I started talking about working with was with Gavin Wood.
[01:39] Like, Gavin Wood was the one who introduced me to the idea of making a browser.
[01:40] I sort of introduced me to the idea of making a browser.
[01:41] My way of getting to work with downloaded what was the latest client CPP, the C client, and then it was called Aleph0.
[01:42] And if you ever, you should try to Google how that looked like, because it felt like the command of an Airbus, like lots of small windows setting showing all sort of buttons and things you had to push.
[01:43] It was super complex.
[01:44] But I still looked at it and say, whoa, this is like a fantastic test gap.
[01:45] I wish it was simpler to use.
[01:46] And I designed something which was very similar to what the Mist Wallet looked like.
[01:47] And then I was very proud showing that to Gav.
[01:48] And he called me to have a Skype call.
[01:49] And then he told me, look, I thought I had basically retransformed the whole thing.
[01:50] And he told me, no, I think you're not going far enough.
[01:51] I think you're not thinking big enough about this.
[01:52] I was like, look, I, I took this thing that was weird.
[01:53] I made it something that looks usable.
[01:54] It looks like a blockchain, but instead of sending coins, you send contracts and you execute stuff.
[01:55] And it was like, no, this is going to be the foundation of a new web, and we are calling this web3.
[01:56] And it's going to be like it's going to replace the Internet browser as you know it.
[01:57] It's going to be going to be better than Onion.
[01:58] And it's, it's going to be like you're going to download apps directly from your peers, from your peers.
[01:59] So apps would never go online.
[02:00] And I was like, wow, this is, this is crazy.
[02:01] I want to be a part of this.
[02:02] And then I, I got into the Jeff team, right?
[02:03] There was basically three teams in the early days of the foundation.
[02:04] It was Vitalik, Jeff, and Gav.
[02:05] Vitalik was doing, was working in Python, was mostly almost a research part.
[02:06] You know, he was mostly interested in knowing if the thing worked.
[02:07] And Gavin and Jeff really were doing the hard clients, one in Gueterion and the other in C.
[02:08] And when I joined the GAF team, I was like the third person to join the GEV team.
[02:09] It was like Jeff Felix, Victor Tron, which then became the head of Swarm, and then me or something like that.
[02:10] And I started trying to build an interface on top of that.
[02:11] And it was very hard, it was very complicated.
[02:12] And I asked Jeff, look, Jeff, I think if you want to really build a wallet, we need someone who has a lot of experience building apps on the web, right?
[02:13] Something that you can use CSS, you can use custom JavaScript to build apps.
[02:14] Not only build the app itself, but to build the apps inside that.
[02:15] And he was like, yep, I know just a guy.
[02:16] Like, there's this crazy guy that came up on a few meetups.
[02:17] He was talking very excited about Ethereum, and we don't know what to do with him, but maybe he can help.
[02:18] And then that's how I started working with Fabian.
[02:19] I called him, and in theory, he was working for me, but I guess he never got the memo because he was like, he was bossing me around and giving orders, and it was great, right?
[02:20] The way it worked would be that I would often come up with an idea, and then I would tell him, I think we should do this.
[02:21] And he was like, no, I don't think that's going to work.
[02:22] And then I was going to say, no, no, I think it is going to work.
[02:23] And I modified my idea a little bit, and then told him, like, gave him back to him.
[02:24] And then he came to me, and I still don't think it's going to work; we should do this instead.
[02:25] And then at some point, on this debate going back and forth, we would come to a very usable solution that he was able to implement like in a day.
[02:26] He was very good at implementing stuff very quickly, and that made me very impressed by Fabian, right?
[02:27] He was a fantastic coder.
[02:28] He wrote the book on what was the standard of web development back then.
[02:29] Back then, everybody was talking about Meteor, and he wrote a book on Meteor that was great.
[02:30] Working with him was great.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:31] Wow, that's, that's amazing.
[02:32] I didn't realize he wrote a book.
[02:33] He wrote like a book before getting into Web3, just about regular, like Web2 development.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:34] Yeah, he wrote a book on Web2 development.
[02:35] Like, back then, everybody was using all sorts of JavaScript libraries to build webs.
[02:36] And I think Meteor was the one thing that you used to, if you wanted to have like a single-page application, right?
[02:37] You wanted to have a web page that looks like an application, which is a standard today.
[02:38] Every page looks like an application.
[02:39] But back then, it was actually very hard to do.
[02:40] And Meteor was a very popular library.
[02:41] And Fabian basically wrote a book on Meteor.
[02:42] So he was very deep into that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:43] Wow, that's super interesting.
[02:44] So who's, like, whose idea was it to kind of make this fun little token to touch the features and give it away to users on Reddit?
[02:45] And why pick Reddit rather than, like, Bitcoin Talk, which was, like, what was predominantly used back then?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:46] Yeah, so here's the thing, right?
[02:47] We didn't use Bitcoin Talk at all.
[02:48] We were using Reddit because Reddit was one of the main forums.
[02:49] It was the forum.Eugenia.org, which is not around anymore.
[02:50] And there was Reddit.
[02:51] That was the main form of communication.
[02:52] And we think about Bitcoin Talk, where people would launch new coins and projects, but we weren't launching a new project online.
[02:53] So let's talk about tokens in the first place, right?
[02:54] Where does the idea of making tokens come from?
[02:55] Well, that has always been there.
[02:56] In fact, one of the first things on the white paper is Ethereum is used to do tokens.
[02:57] And they became obvious because what was happening back then, it was Bitcoin.
[02:58] And then whenever someone wanted to launch a new thing to build on top of it, they would launch a whole new token.
[02:59] And so they were like, oh, I want to do this blockchain thing, but I want to use it for storing names.
[03:00] And then they launched a fork of Bitcoin called Namecoin.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:01] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:02] And someone else thought, oh, you know what, we should have property assets inside here, we could.
[03:03] And then they launched Colored Coin, which was a whole new thing.
[03:04] They tried to don't, at some point, it was on top of Bitcoin, then it wasn't, and then someone started doing Master Coin.
[03:05] And Master Coin was like, oh no, I think what you should do is that we should have an exchange inside, so you can send the coin or ask for an exchange or send a token.
[03:06] And basically, every time anyone wanted to do something new, they had to make a new opcode for Master Coin.
[03:07] And Vitalik was working with Master Coin and Corn Coin back then.
[03:08] And that's when Cesar realized that's very inefficient.
[03:09] The idea that you have to either release a whole new blockchain whenever someone else thinks about a new feature or that you need to create a whole new upgrade to your blockchain.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:10] I think you might have wronged there.
[03:11] I can't hear you.
[03:12] Is it just me?
[03:13] Matt, can you hear him?

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:14] Not sure if.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:15] That.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:16] With the chains, they really do allow you to be able to take tokens out of the wallet, and there is no way to.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:17] There is no way to approve.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:18] So if you think about it, Uniswap and a lot of marketplaces, anywhere we would want to execute a transaction, for it to be a function on a set of contracts, you need to do that execution and send error inside of the value of the transaction.
[03:19] Which gets a little bit tricky because you only basically pass an error of Ethereum from function to function to function.
[03:20] And if you can't have it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:21] You.

**SPEAKER_03:**
[03:22] Can approve, and the contracts can pull the tokens out of your wallet.
[03:23] It also is very good for tracking exchange exchange.
[03:24] We have this quantity, obviously, Alex is back, but we wanted to pull to instead of pushing from.
[03:25] It's a lot better for training.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:26] All right, let's see.
[03:27] All right, good.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:28] I'm back here.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:29] All right, yeah.
[03:30] Awesome, yeah, no, that's great.
[03:31] Yeah, so I don't even know where you left off.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:32] I was talking about tokens.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:33] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:34] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:35] Am I the only one who heard who couldn't understand anything that Max said because he was very distorted, or.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:36] Yeah, he was a bit distorted.
[03:37] I don't know what's going on with that.
[03:38] Okay, so yeah, so you were talking about, like, you know, Master Coin and those types of projects, and you had to, like, you know, release a whole token and stuff.
[03:39] I was just asking more about, like, who decided to just, like, play with the Mist Token and just, like, oh, let's just give it away for free on Reddit, like, well, that's what I'm getting at.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:40] Right, so we knew tokens were important, and then at some point, I posted on Reddit, like, hey, let's talk about the coin standard.
[03:41] Let's talk about something, there was a very interesting conversation out of that.
[03:42] Based on that conversation, Fabian wrote the ERC standard.
[03:43] And when we released the new Beast wallet, we wanted people to try out because there were no tokens on Ethereum.
[03:44] There was nothing you could tokenize.
[03:45] So we basically released two tokens, one came with the wallet, and it was the unicorn thing.
[03:46] Whenever you donated to the foundation, you got a unicorn.
[03:47] And the other that we wanted people to be able to play with for free was just like something that Fabian created, literally for fun, just using the standard thing that they had, and then just started giving away for free on Reddit, just for people to try it out.
[03:48] Nobody gave a lot of thought about it.
[03:49] It was just, this is the best thing that we want to try out, and we wanted people to play around with.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:50] Of course, yeah, no, I get it.
[03:51] And in regards to the unicorn, the unicorn token was, like, five, six months later, though, right?
[03:52] It, yeah, I mean, based on the contracts, I don't know if it was, like, talked about like internally and not released until later.
[03:53] But yeah, it was released in 2016, a couple of months.
[03:54] I think it was two or three months.
[03:55] And I, I think unicorns are great, too, but, I mean, I, I, I can't, they're very hard to get a hold of.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:56] So, yeah, I mean, as you say, like trust, trust the timestamp, right?
[03:57] I mean, I, like, if you were asking me, I wouldn't swear that we released both of them at the same time when we released the tokens on the wallet.
[03:58] Maybe we hadn't, like, that, like.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:59] Yeah, I don't think you did, but the thing is that the Unicorn is actually, like, an ERC-20, quote-unquote, actually, in ERC-20, because Mist is basically an ERC-20, besides the approved function.
[04:00] So it was, like, that's why, if you go look at the unicorns, I'm pretty sure they have all of the ERC-20 standard implemented, whereas Mist is basically, like, the skeleton for it.
[04:01] You know, it's just missing a few parts, or one part, and then it would be considered a full ERC-20.
[04:02] But Fabian considers it, I think you had a, you know, a good outlook on exactly, you know, how it met the standard, and besides the approval function.
[04:03] But yeah, that, that's super, super interesting.
[04:04] I was gonna say, was there anyone else that kind of helped in, like, whether it be, like, just ideating, or actually getting in there and coding?
[04:05] Because I know you said you didn't, you weren't really a coder that kind of helped with the figuring out this ERC-20 standard.
[04:06] Was it really just Fabian, I know you mentioned Gavin Wood, I didn't know if he was kind of in the coding side of things, too, or was it really just, like, Fabian, when it comes to the actual coding part of it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:07] Well, we had a lot of feedback from the community regarding how to build the tokens.
[04:08] There were some projects, I think the guys from MakerDAO, I think Rune was already participating on that.
[04:09] Rune from ACD, he was already saying, look, we have this project, we already released a big number of tokens, and that was.
[04:10] They were claiming about other tokens that they were working on, on that project that they had.
[04:11] And, of course, there was no standard for that.
[04:12] And that's sort of why we wanted, yeah, sure, but you release a token, but that doesn't mean that we need a standard, so that everyone can release tokens, and those tokens can exist on wallets, and things like that.
[04:13] But I think Fabian basically got the feedback from the whole community as a whole that, like, wrote the ERC standard.
[04:14] And those things were very participatory, right?
[04:15] So, writing a standard is, by its design, something that you want to have the buying of the community.
[04:16] You want to have a lot of feedback, so that everyone can, at some point, just agree on something, right?
[04:17] So, it's not something that you just come out and say, hey, this is how the foundation is going to do, no, we want to hear it, and you want to make sure that everyone is following the standard, otherwise, it won't be a standard, will we just have a proprietary format?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:18] Yeah, yeah, that kind of leads me into my next question, which is, did you believe, like, ERC-20 would kind of achieve this relevance and be as big as it is here, like 10 years later?
[04:19] Or did you expect a better or newer standard to come around?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:20] We knew tokens were super important for Ethereum, right?
[04:21] Like, back when we were working on the Mist Wallet, basically, all other crypto wallets served for, like, every other Ethereum wallet had one function in mind, which was, you get the wallet, you get from the pre-sale, you get your ether, and you send it to an exchange to sell, right?
[04:22] Or you just bought something in an exchange, and you send it to yourself.
[04:23] That was the only reason that anyone did use a wallet, and we were like, and there were, like, a lot of other wallets back then, and all of them were just that, right?
[04:24] It was just a way for you to get your ether back and sell it, and we really wanted to fix that by creating those functions, we need to invent new cool stuff that people want to work with, and that's why it was really important for us to start working on tokens.
[04:25] Did you expect the ERC-20?
[04:26] Here's something funny that I didn't expect, so we really expect tokens themselves to be big, I did not expect the word ERC-20 to be so big, right?
[04:27] To the point that Bitcoin tokens are known as BRC-20, which is sort of like laughable, because it wasn't the 20 of anything, right?
[04:28] 20 doesn't mean tokens, 20 was just a random number that happened to be the order in which Fabian asked the questions, so and suddenly, like BRC-20 becomes the center, I think that's hilarious.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:29] Yeah, I mean, that's imitation, a serious form of flattery, right?

**SPEAKER_04:**
[04:30] They.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:31] It's kind of, even though those, like BRC-20s, don't even have, like, smart contracts or anything like that, it's a totally different kind of tech, but it just pays homage to the fact of how important the ERC-20 was to, you know, the development of the tech, I mean, you're a pioneer, I mean, you, Fabian, everyone that was a part of this, like, you guys created something, like, even though the Mist Wallet went into sunset, at some point, like, the, you know, the mark you guys had on, on, on just cryptocurrency, in blockchain, in the world, is, it's honestly really nuts, and it's crazy that you weren't even really expecting it to have, you know, that much.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:32] Let me say a little bit, because you keep calling me a pioneer, and how, like, how everything we did, I think, whenever you get a new community, right, you find that it's always, like, it's very few people working there, right?
[04:33] Whenever I got there, they were probably less than 100 total people working on anything Ethereum, so anything you do, if you start working on a project, and then that project becomes big, then all those little marks that you do, of course, they also become big, and they also create ripples, and you can trace that ripple back to the persons that were there, but the thing is, those ripples only matter because the project grew, and the project grows because a lot of thousands of factors, right?
[04:34] So, I think, I think the main, I would say that, if someone, if someone thinks about it, wow, but here's the cool thing, is that there are, at any point in history, there are thousands, a million other projects that are happening, or things are happening, which will eventually grow, like, we can look back and say, oh, this thing became big, and therefore, the people there were special, because they were there, but my point is, if you guys are people who care about leaving ripples, and things like that, my suggestion would be just to find projects that will, that will allow those ripples to be big, right?
[04:35] I, I don't think it's the action of those pioneers that are super important, etc., it's just that we happen to be there, and we did a good job, that I was proud of, but I think those opportunities are always coming, right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:36] No, yeah, I agree, and it's just about, you know, building, really, at the end of the day, like, building something you're passionate about, but regardless of the fact you're a pioneer, a lot of people agree, so maybe you weren't going into that with the mindset of, hey, I'm a pioneer, you're just in there, you know, building, trying to do cool stuff, a part of something that you think had a lot of potential, and that, to me, is, is a definition of a pioneer, whether you, whether you had that mindset going into it, but I think we all appreciate you hearing what you've done.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:37] But that, that was my first suggestion, right?
[04:38] If, if, if anyone wants to, like, if anyone wants to, like, own a part of history, the best way to do it is to invent it, and is to help write it, right?
[04:39] I think that is the beauty part, it is, so I really urge everyone who, like, loves to look back at history, is also to think that, in 20 years, whatever you do now will be part of history, right?
[04:40] So, just, like, try to think enough, try to think about, like, where you want to be, right now, that probably can be something big in the future, because that's exciting, and even if you bet on the wrong horse, just betting, just being able to build things that last, and don't last, is a great experience, I built tons of things that were forgotten, and didn't last, and disappeared over the years, before I stumbled into Ethereum, and even the things I built into Ethereum, I would say that almost all the projects I built were things that didn't last, and they broke down, but the building blocks that we sort of accidentally created to build those things became much bigger than the projects I was building, I ever expected to be.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:41] Right.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:42] Things like the token, things like ENS, things like block this standards, for a lot of, like, small things, like the icons that use color icons, you see on EtherScan, those fingers, just a tiny feature for the wallet, and they became big projects in themselves, much bigger than the wallet could actually be, and I think that's super fun.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:43] Yeah, I mean, you're, you're moving, motivating me right now, to get out there, and build, I, I, I really appreciate it, yeah, everybody should really build, I mean, at the end of the day, like, like you said, like, you might as well put a bet out there, instead of not even jumping in the game, I mean, you know, who knows, you could be one of those pioneers, you could change the game, even, even though you're just building something that you, you know, might not change the game, but at least, you know, you're in there, actually trying to make a difference, in something you're passionate about, but yeah, no, that's, that's cool, great, like, that kind of leads me to question, you were just mentioning some of it, like, outside of, like, the creation of the ERC-20, and even ENS, what do you think was your greatest contribution, in those early days, I know there was the development of the things, like the Web3js library, the easy-to-use wallet interface, the blocky Identicon, and Camel case checksum, I know those were a lot of great developments, is it one of those, or is it, like, potentially something else, that I didn't mention?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:44] I, so something like, I, I'm very proud of all of that, right?
[04:45] But there's another very interesting project that I think, what I did, after Ethereum Foundation, is I started working on a project, which I called Unilogin, which was another project that went nowhere, but also, a lot of the ideas that were there, are starting to come around, and I think those would be super important.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:46] Right.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:47] And what I wanted to do on Unilogin, was I wanted everyone to stop using private keys for their crypto, right?
[04:48] I founded, like, private key, was something that wasn't user, that a user should never see, and my point was, I think, that everyone should have smart wallets, and that a private key was something that your device created, never took out of the device, and whenever you lost that device, you just replace it with another one, and so I worked
