**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] What's going on, everybody?
[00:03] Alex, I sent you an invite to speak and cohost.
[00:07] If you have any questions, just let me know. You can DM me.
[00:11] Good to see the faces piling in.
[00:13] Got a lot of good questions here.
[00:15] Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.
[00:18] There we go.
[00:19] Alex, good to have you here, man. Appreciate it.
[00:22] If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions, just feel free to raise your hand.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:27] Kinda.
[00:28] Kinda a bit, like, underwater.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:30] Is Victor out here?
[00:32] No.
[00:33] Victor.
[00:34] Okay.
[00:35] Let me see.
[00:36] Just give us a few moments, guys, trying to set this up.
[00:39] Appreciate your patience.
[00:40] Technology.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:42] Cartoons, you wanna come up?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:44] I'll invite you.
[00:45] Even if you're just on a panel, you don't gotta speak.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:48] You are here for episode zero.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:50] Got you, Mac.
[00:52] Wishing my phone wasn't so dumb.
[00:54] I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:57] You should sing, AG.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:59] Who said that?
[01:00] Alex?
[01:01] Hey.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:02] Hey.
[01:03] You should play some live music.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:05] I was playing some classical music, but yeah, I don't know.
[01:08] It's good to have you on here.
[01:10] I'm glad the mic's all working out now.
[01:12] I really appreciate you jumping on.
[01:14] It's been an interesting six months for sure.
[01:16] So really, I just wanna kinda pick your brain a bit about the past, honestly.
[01:20] More than just, you know, Mist Coin in general, but really just like how you got all started with the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot.
[01:26] So like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum and what was your kind of first initial reaction to it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:32] Sure.
[01:33] I have to say my wife thinks it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now.
[01:38] So I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's fun.
[01:41] So I think I started being interested in making Bitcoin around 2012.
[01:46] So that was, like, it feels like a long time ago.
[01:49] It feels like the early days, but for me, I already felt like, oh god, I missed it.
[01:53] They're already talking about Bitcoin on The Good Wife on live TV.
[01:56] I was like, oh no.
[01:57] It used to be under a dollar.
[01:59] Now it's $10.
[02:00] Damn. I so missed Bitcoin. Right?
[02:03] That's too bad.
[02:04] I even remember, like, I posted something on the forum saying, oh no, I tried buying Bitcoin at $5.
[02:09] I paid. It was so hard.
[02:11] And then someone simply, like, I think tipped me like 5 Bitcoin on Reddit saying, hey, here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin.
[02:17] And it was, like, back then, I don't know, probably a full Bitcoin.
[02:20] Right? So like, Bitcoin was $5 back then.
[02:23] So that was those early days.
[02:25] Again, didn't feel too early.
[02:27] And then I started paying attention because I felt that I knew someone bigger would come for Bitcoin.
[02:32] And I just started following all sorts of projects, like Mastercoin and things like that.
[02:37] And so I found Ethereum.
[02:39] And I was, wow, I was so blown away and captivated that I couldn't think of anything else.
[02:44] The people were still very active on the Reddit, like, would answer questions personally.
[02:48] And then I just started helping out on the forum, on the Reddit.
[02:51] I'm a designer. I'm not a coder.
[02:53] So I thought, hey, there are enough coders here.
[02:55] Maybe they need a designer.
[02:57] And then someone would ask something for a presentation, I could give them.
[03:00] And then by the time that the presale rolled around, they started having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list.
[03:06] So that's how I got started working with some crazy people.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:10] So you did not expect to be so heavily involved and become the pioneer that you did.
[03:14] You were just kind of jumping in and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really.
[03:18] You didn't expect it to blow up like this.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:20] I certainly didn't expect it to—like, sort of yes and no.
[03:23] Because I felt that back then, it seemed very obvious that it was going to be a big thing.
[03:27] And I was like, I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this.
[03:30] I felt like telling everybody I knew, can't you see?
[03:33] Look at this. This is crazy.
[03:35] It's like a blockchain, but it's a computer inside.
[03:38] And people were acting like I was crazy.
[03:40] I was a founder of a company back then.
[03:42] I was doing an iPhone app, sort of like Instagram for fashion lists.
[03:45] And I had raised money, but the app wasn't going anywhere.
[03:48] And I realized that I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app.
[03:52] I was just thinking about Ethereum all the time.
[03:54] And then I told my friends that I wanted to leave this.
[03:57] They were like, are you leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old that's going to pay you in made-up money that he invented?
[04:03] I was like, yeah. Sure. That seems like a great idea.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:07] Yeah. That's crazy, man.
[04:09] Honestly, just your belief in what this could turn out to be ended up leading you to such success and being a pioneer in this space.
[04:16] So when we talked before in the past, you told me you kinda helped assemble the Mist Wallet development team.
[04:21] You explained you were part of the hiring, and you brought Fabian on board.
[04:25] How did you go about getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team, and what made you so confident in his abilities?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:31] So when I started working, the first person I started talking about working with was Gavin Wood.
[04:36] Gavin Wood was the one who sort of introduced me to the idea of making a browser.
[04:40] I would say that really the way I got to work was that I downloaded what was the latest client, C++ client, and then it was called AlethZero.
[04:47] And if you ever— you should try to Google how that looked like because it felt like the command of an Airbus.
[04:52] Lots of small windows showing all sorts of buttons and things you had to push.
[04:56] It was super complex.
[04:57] But I still looked at it and said, whoa, this is like a fantastic app.
[05:00] I wish it was simpler to use.
[05:02] And I designed something which was very similar to what the Mist Wallet looked like.
[05:06] And then I was very proud showing that to Gavin.
[05:08] He called me to have a Skype call and then he told me, look, I thought I had basically transformed the whole thing.
[05:13] He told me, no. I think you're not going far enough.
[05:16] I think you're not thinking big enough about this.
[05:18] I was like, look, I took this thing that was weird and I made it something that looks usable.
[05:22] It looks like a blockchain, which is what it is, right?
[05:24] It's a blockchain, but instead of sending coins, you send contracts and you execute stuff.
[05:28] And he was like, no. This is going to be the foundation of a new web.
[05:32] We are calling this Web3 and there's going to be a browser and there's going to be client interfaces.
[05:36] You're going to download it via torrent or via Swarm.
[05:39] You're going to talk to people directly via P2P.
[05:41] It's going to replace the Internet browser as we know it.
[05:44] It's going to be better than Onion.
[05:46] Instead of downloading the apps from a server, you're going to be downloading it from your peers, from your friends.
[05:50] So apps will never go offline.
[05:52] And I was like, wow. This is crazy. I want to be a part of this.
[05:56] And then I got into the Geth team.
[05:58] In the early days of the foundation, it was Vitalik, Jeff, and Gavin.
[06:02] Vitalik was working in Python, mostly almost a research part, mostly interested in knowing if the thing worked.
[06:07] And Gavin and Jeff really were doing the hard clients, one in Go (Geth) and the other in C++.
[06:12] And when I joined the Geth team, I was like the third person to join the Geth team.
[06:16] It was Jeff, Felix, Victor Tron (who then became the head of Swarm), and then me.
[06:20] I started trying to build an interface on top of that, and it was very hard.
[06:23] It was very complicated.
[06:24] And I asked Jeff, look, Jeff, I think if you want to really build a wallet, we need someone who has a lot of experience building apps on the web.
[06:30] Someone that can use CSS, custom JavaScript to build apps.
[06:34] Not only build the app itself, but to build the app inside that.
[06:37] And he was like, yep. I know just the guy.
[06:39] There's this crazy guy that came up on a few meetups.
[06:42] He was very excited about Ethereum, and we don't know what to do with him, but maybe he can help.
[06:46] And then that's how I started working with Fabian.
[06:48] I called him, and in theory, he was working for me, but I guess he never got the memo because he was bossing me around and giving orders.
[06:54] And it was great.
[06:55] The way it worked would be that I would often come up with an idea, and then I would tell him, I think we should do this.
[07:00] And he was like, no. I don't think that's going to work.
[07:03] And then I would say, no, I think it is going to work, and I would modify my idea a little bit and give it back to him.
[07:08] And then he came to me, and I still don't think it's going to work. We should do this instead.
[07:12] And then at some point in this debate going back and forth, we would come to a very usable solution that he was able to implement in a day.
[07:19] He was very good at implementing stuff very quickly, and that made me very impressed by Fabian.
[07:24] He was a fantastic coder.
[07:26] He wrote the book on what was the standard of web development back then.
[07:29] Back then, everybody was talking about Meteor.
[07:31] I mean, he wrote a book on Meteor.
[07:33] That was great working with him.
