**SPEAKER_00:**
What's going on, everybody? Alex, I sent you an invite to speak and co-host. If you have any questions, just let me know. You can DM me. Good to see the faces piling in. Got a lot of good questions here. Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here. There we go. Alex, good to have you here, man. Appreciate it. If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions, just feel free to raise your hand.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Kinda... Kinda a bit, like, underwater.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Is Victor out here? No. Victor. Okay. Let me see. Just give us a few moments, guys, trying to set this up. Appreciate your patience. Technology.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Cartoons, you wanna come up?

**SPEAKER_00:**
I'll invite you. Even if you're just on a panel, you don't gotta speak.

**SPEAKER_01:**
You are here for episode zero.

**SPEAKER_00:**
But you got you, Mac. Wishing my phone wasn't so dumb. I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

**SPEAKER_02:**
You should sing, AG.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Who said that? Alex? Hey.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Hey. You should play some live music.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I was playing some classical music, but, yeah, I don't know. It's good to have you on here. I'm glad the mic's all working out now. I really appreciate you jumping on. It's been an interesting six months for sure. So, really, I just wanna kinda just pick your brain a bit about the past, honestly. Like, more than just Mist coin in general, but really just how you got all started with the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot. So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum and what was your kind of first initial reaction to it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Sure. I have to say my wife thinks it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now. So I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's fun. So I think I started being interested in making Bitcoin around 2012. So that was, like, it feels like a long time ago. It feels like the early days, but for me, I already felt like, "Oh god, I missed it. They're already talking about Bitcoin on *The Good Wife* on live TV. I like, oh, no. But, like, it used to be under a dollar. Now it's $10. Damn. I so missed Bitcoin." Right? That's too bad.

I even remember, like, I posted something on the forum saying, "Oh, no. I tried buying Bitcoin at $5. I paid... It was so hard." And then someone simply, like, I think, tipped me 5 Bitcoin on Reddit saying, "Hey. Here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin." And it was, like, back then, I don't know, like, probably a full Bitcoin. Right? So, like, Bitcoin was $5 back then. So that was those early days. Again, didn't feel too early.

And then I started paying attention because I felt that I knew someone bigger would come for Bitcoin. And I just started following all sorts of projects, like Mastercoin and things like that. And so I found Ethereum. And I was, wow. I was so blown away and captivated that I couldn't think of anything else. The people were still very active on the Reddit. Like, would answer questions personally. And then I just started helping out on the forum, on the Reddit. I'm a designer. I'm not a coder. So I thought, hey, like, there are enough coders here. Maybe they need a designer, and then someone would ask something for a presentation I could give them. And then by the time that the presale rolled around, they started having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list. So that's how I started working with some crazy people.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So you did not expect to be so heavily involved and become the pioneer that you did. You were just kind of jumping in and interested in this new opportunity, really. You didn't expect it to blow up like this.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I certainly didn't expect it to... like, sort of yes and no because I felt that back then, it seemed very obvious that it was going to be a big thing. And I was like, I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this. I felt like telling everybody I knew. "Can't you see? Look at this shit. This is crazy. It's like a blockchain, but it's a computer inside." And people were acting as crazy... acting so as crazy.

I was a founder of a company back then. I was doing an iPhone app, sort of like Instagram for fashionistas, and I had raised money. But the app wasn't going anywhere, and I realized that I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app. I was just thinking about Ethereum all the time. And then I told my friends that I wanted to leave this. They were like, "Are you leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old that's going to pay you in, like, makeup money that he invented?" I was like, "Yeah. Sure. That seems like a great idea."

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That's crazy, man. That's honestly the... I mean, just your belief in what this could turn out to ended up leading you to such success and being a pioneer in this space. So when we talked before in the past, you told me you kinda helped assemble the Mist Wallet development team. You explained you were part of the hiring, and you brought Fabian on board. How did you go about getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team, and what made you so confident in his abilities?

**SPEAKER_02:**
So when I started working, the first person I started talking about working with was Gavin Wood. Gavin Wood was the one who sort of introduced me to the idea of making a browser. I would say that really the way I got to work was that I downloaded what was the latest client, the C++ client—back then it was called AlephZero. And if you ever... you should try to Google how that looked like because it felt like the command of an Airbus. Like, lots of small windows setting showing all sorts of buttons and things you had to push. It was super complex. But I still looked at it and said, "Woah, this is like a fantastic app. I wish it was simpler to use."

And I designed something which was very similar to what the Mist Wallet looked like. And then I was very proud showing that to Gavin. And he called me to have a Skype call and then he told me, "Look..." I thought I had basically retransformed the whole thing. He told me, "No. I think you're not going far enough. I think you're not thinking big enough about this." I was like, "Look, I took this thing that was weird and I made it something that looks usable. It looks like a blockchain."

He said, "No. This is going to be the foundation of a new web. We are calling this Web3 and there's going to be a browser and there's going to be like client interfaces and you're gonna download it via torrent or via Swarm. You're gonna talk to people directly via P2P. It's going to replace the Internet browser as we know it. It's going to be better than Tor and onion routing. Now you're going to download apps directly—instead of downloading the apps from a server, you're going to be downloading it from your peers, from your friends. So apps will never go offline." And I was like, "Wow. This is crazy. I wanna be a part of this."

And then I got into the Go team. Right? There was in the early days of the Foundation. It was Vitalik, Jeff [Wilcke], and Gavin. Vitalik was mostly almost on the research part, you know, which was mostly interested in knowing if the thing worked. And Gavin and Jeff really were doing the hard clients, one in Go Ethereum [Geth] and the other in C++. And when I joined the Geth team, I was like the third person to join. It was like Jeff, Felix [Lange], Viktor Trón—which then became the head of Swarm—and then me, right? Or something like that.

And I started trying to build an interface on top of that, and it was very hard. It was very complicated. And I asked Jeff, "Look, Jeff. I think if you wanna really build a wallet, we need someone who has a lot of experience building apps with the web. Right? Something that you can use CSS, you can use custom JavaScript to build apps. Not only build the app itself, but to build the app inside that." And he was like, "Yep. I know just the guy. There's this crazy guy that came up on a few meetups. He was talking very excited about Ethereum, and we don't know what to do with him, but maybe he can help."

And then that's how I started working with Fabian [Vogelsteller]. I called him, and, like, in theory, he was working for me, but I guess he never got the memo because he was bossing me around and giving orders, and it was great. The way it worked would be that I would often come up with an idea, and then I would tell him, "I think we should do this." And he was like, "No. I don't think that's going to work." And then I was going to say, "No, no. I think it is going to work," and I modified my idea a little bit and gave it back to him. And then he came to me, "I still don't think it is going to work. We should do this instead." And then at some point on this debate going back and forth, we would come to a very usable solution that he was able to implement, like, in a day. He was very good at implementing stuff very quickly and that made me very impressed by Fabian. He was a fantastic coder. He wrote the book on what was the standard of web development back then. Like, back then, everybody was talking about Meteor. He wrote a book on Meteor. That was great working with him.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Wow. That's amazing. I didn't realize he wrote a book. He wrote the book before getting into Web3 just about regular, like, Web2 development?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. He wrote a book on Web2 development. Like, back then, everybody was using all sorts of JavaScript libraries to build web. I think Meteor was the one thing that you used if you wanted to have like a single page application. Right? You wanted to have a web page that looks like an application, which is the standard today. Every page looks like an application, but back then it was actually very hard to do. Meteor was a very popular library. Fabian basically wrote a book on Meteor. So he was very deep into that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Wow. That's super interesting. So whose idea was it to kinda make this make a fun little token to touch the features and give it away to users on Reddit? And why pick Reddit rather than, like, BitcoinTalk, which was what was predominantly used back then?

**SPEAKER_02:**
So here's the thing. We didn't use BitcoinTalk at all. We were using Reddit because Reddit was... we used two main forums. It was the forum.ethereum.org, which doesn't exist anymore, and there was Reddit. That was the main form of communication. And we think about BitcoinTalk where people would launch new coins and projects, but we weren't launching a new project of mine.

So let's talk about tokens in the first place, right? Where does the idea of making tokens come from? Well, that has always been there. In fact, one of the first things on the white paper is Ethereum can be used to do tokens. And that became obvious because what was happening back then, it was Bitcoin. And then whenever someone wanted to launch or invent a new thing to build on top of it, they would launch a whole new token. So they were like, "Oh, I wanna do this blockchain thing, but I wanna use it for storing names." And then they launched a fork of Bitcoin called Namecoin. And then someone else thought, "Oh, you know what? We should have property assets inside here." And then they launched Colored Coins, which was a whole not real thing they tried to do at some point on top of Bitcoin, then it wasn't.

And then someone started doing... and then Mastercoin was like, "Oh, no. I think what you should do is that we should have an exchange inside. So you can send the coin or ask for an exchange or send a token." And basically every time anyone wanted to do something new, they had to make a new opcode for Mastercoin. And Vitalik was working with Mastercoin and Colored Coins back then. And that's when he realized that's very inefficient, the idea that you have to either release a whole new blockchain whenever someone else thinks about a new feature or that you need to create a whole new upgrade to your blockchain. So...

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think you might have cut out there. Can't hear you. Is it just me, Mac? Can you hear him?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Alright. Let's see.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Alright. Good. I'm back. Yeah. Alright. Awesome. I don't even know where you left off.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I was talking about tokens. Yeah. Talking about tokens. Am I the only one who couldn't understand anything that Mac said because he was very distorted?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. He was a bit distorted. I don't know what's going on with that. Okay. So yeah. So you were talking about Mastercoin and those types of projects, and you had to release a whole token and stuff. I was asking more about who decided to just play with the Mist token and just, "Oh, let's just give it away for free on Reddit."

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh, that's what I'm getting at. Right? So we knew tokens were important. And then at some point, we decided, "Hey. We want to do a token release on this." And I posted on Reddit, "Hey. Let's talk about the coin standard. Let's talk about something." There was a very interesting conversation out of that. Based on that conversation, Fabian wrote the ERC standard.

When we released the new Mist wallet, we wanted people to try out because there were no tokens on Ethereum. Like, there was nothing you could tokenize. So we basically released two tokens. One came with the wallet and was the unicorn thing; whenever you donated to the Foundation you got a unicorn. And the other that we wanted people to be able to play with for free was just like something that Fabian created literally for fun just using the standard thing that they had. And then just started giving away on Reddit just for people to try it out. Like, nobody gave a lot of thought about it. It was just this is the best thing that we wanted to try out and wanted people to play around with.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Of course. Yeah. No. I get it. And in regards to the unicorn, the unicorn token was, like, five, six months later, though. Right? Is it? Yeah. I mean, based on the contracts, I don't know if it was talked about internally, but not released until later. But, yeah, it was released in 2016, a couple of months. I think it was two or three months.

**SPEAKER_02:**
And I think unicorns are great too, but I mean, they're very hard to get ahold of. So yeah. I mean, as you say, like, trust the timestamp. Right? I mean, if you were asking me, I would swear that we released both of them at the same time when we released the tokens on the wallet.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Maybe we hadn't that, like... Yeah. You I don't think, yeah, you did, but the thing is that unicorn is actually like an ERC-20, quote-unquote, actually an ERC-20 because Mist is basically an ERC-20 besides the `approve` function. So it was like, that's why if you go look at the unicorns, I'm pretty sure they have all of the ERC-20 standard implemented, whereas Mist is basically, like, the skeleton for it. You know? It's just missing a few parts or one part, and then it would be considered a full ERC-20. But Fabian considers it... I think you had a good outlook on exactly how it met the standard besides the approval function. But yeah. That's super interesting. I was gonna say, was there anyone else that kinda helped in ideating or actually getting in there and coding? Because I know you said you weren't really a coder that kinda helped with figuring out this ERC-20 standard. Was it really just Fabian? I know you mentioned Gavin Wood. I didn't know if he was kinda in the coding side of things too, or was it really just like Fabian when it comes to the actual coding part of it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well, we had a lot of feedback from the community in regards on on how to build the tokens. There were a lot of some projects that I think the guys from Maker or I think Rune [Christensen] was already participating on that. Rune from MakerDAO. He was already saying, "Look. We have this project. And we already released a big number of tokens," and that was like... they were claiming about their token that they were working on on that project that they had. And, of course, there was no standard for that, and that's sort of why we wanted, "Yeah, sure. But you release a token, but that doesn't mean that... we need a standard so that everyone can release tokens and those tokens can exist on wallets and things like that."

But I think so Fabian basically got the feedback from the whole community as a whole. Like, wrote the standard, and those things were very... it was a very participatory project. Right? So writing a standard is by its design something that you want to have the buy-in of the community. You want to have a lot of feedback so that everyone can at some point just agree on something. Right? So it's not something that you just come out and say, "Hey. This is how the Foundation is going to do it." No. We wanna hear it, and we wanna make sure that everyone is following the standard. Otherwise, it won't be a standard. We just do a proprietary for that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That kinda leads me into my next question is, did you believe, like, ERC-20 would kind of achieve this relevance and be as big as it is here, like, ten years later, or did you expect a better or newer standard to come around?

**SPEAKER_02:**
We knew the tokens were super important for Ethereum. Right? Like, back when we were working on the Mist Wallet, basically, all other crypto wallets served for... especially every other Ethereum wallet had one function in mind, which was: you get the wallet, you got from the presale, you get your ether, and you send it to exchange to sell. Right? Or you just bought something in an exchange and you send it to yourself. That was the only reason that anyone would use a wallet.

And we were like... and there were like a lot of already other wallets back then, and all of them were just that. It was just a way for you to get your ether back and sell it. And we really wanted to fix that by... and we knew that if you wanted people to use Ethereum as we wanted, we need to create those functions. We need to invent new cool stuff that people want to work [on] and that's why it was really important for us to start working on tokens.

Like, did you expect the ERC-20? Here's something funny that I didn't expect. Right? So we really expected tokens themselves to be big. I did not expect the word *ERC-Twenty* to be so big. Right? The point that Bitcoin tokens are known as BRC-20, which is sort of like laughable because it wasn't the 20 of anything. Right? 20 doesn't mean tokens. 20 was just a random number that happened to be the order in which Fabian asked the questions... and suddenly BRC-20 becomes the standard. But I think that's hilarious honestly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, that's imitation. It's a serious form of flattery. Yeah. It's kinda even though those, like, BRC-20s don't even have, like, smart contracts or anything like that, it's a totally different kind of tech. It's just... it just pays homage to the fact of how important the ERC-20 was to kinda the development of the tech. I mean, you're a pioneer. I mean, you, and everyone that was a part of this, like, you guys created something. Like, even though the Mist wallet went and sunsetted at some point, the mark you guys had on just cryptocurrency and blockchain in the world is honestly really nuts, and it's crazy that you weren't even really expecting it to have that much...

**SPEAKER_02:**
Let me say a little bit because you keep calling me a pioneer and how everything we did... I think whenever you get a new community, right, you'll find that it's always very few people working there. Right? When I got there, there was probably less than a 100 people working on anything at Ethereum. So anything you do, if you start working on a project and then that project becomes big, then all those little marks that you do, of course, they also become big and they also create ripples and you can trace that ripple back to the person that were there.

But the thing is those ripples only matter because the project will grow and the project grows because a lot of thousands of factors. Right? So I think... I would say that if someone... if someone thinks about it, wow. I don't... But here's the cool thing is that there's at any point in history, there are a thousand, a million other projects that are happening or things that are happening which will eventually grow. Like we can look back and say, "Oh, this thing became big and therefore the people there were special because they were there."

But my point is if you all you guys are people who care about like leaving ripples and things like that, my suggestion would be like just find projects that will allow that... they will grow and they're allowing those ripples to be big. Right? I don't think it's the action of those pioneers are super important, etcetera. It's just that we happened to be there and we did good work that I was proud of. But I think those opportunities are always coming. Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
No. Yeah. I agree. And it's just about building really at the end of the day and building in something you're passionate about. But regardless of the fact you're a pioneer, a lot of people agree. So maybe you weren't going into that with the mindset of, "Hey, I'm a pioneer." You're just in there trying to do cool stuff upon something that you think had a lot of potential. And that to me is the definition of pioneer whether you had that mindset going into it, but I think we all appreciate hearing what you've done.

**SPEAKER_02:**
But that would be my suggestion. Right? If anyone wants to like own a part of history, the best way to do it is to invent it and is to help write it. Right? I think that is the beauty part. It is so I really urge everyone who likes to look back at history to also think that in twenty years whatever you do now will be part of history. Right? So just like try to think enough. Try to think about what is where you wanna be right now that probably can be something big in the future because that's exciting. And even if you bet on the wrong horse, just betting... just being able to build things that last and don't last is a great experience. I built tons of things that were forgotten and didn't last and disappeared over the years before I stumbled into Ethereum. And maybe the things I built into Ethereum, I would say that almost all the projects I built were things that didn't last and broke down. But the building blocks that we sort of accidentally created to build those things became much bigger than the projects I had expected to be. Right? Things like the token, things like ENS, things like the block... like, the standards for a lot of small things like the colorful icon you see on Etherscan [Blockies]. Those things were just a tiny feature for the wallet and they became big projects in themselves, much bigger than the wallet. And I think that's that is super fun.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. And I mean, you're motivating me right now to get out there and build. I really appreciate... Yeah. Everybody should really build. I mean, at the end of the day, like you said, you might as well put a bet out there instead of not even jumping in the game. I mean, who knows? You could be one of those pioneers. You could change the game even even though you're just building something that you know might not change the game, but at least, you know, you're in there actually trying to make a difference in something you're passionate about.

But yeah. No. That's great. That kinda leads me to the question you were just mentioning some of it. Like, outside of the creation of the ERC-20 and even ENS, what do you think was your greatest contribution in those early days? I know there was the development of the things like the Web3.js library, the easy-to-use wallet interface, the Blocky Identicon, and camel case checksum. I know those were a lot of great developments. Is it one of those, or is it potentially something else that I didn't mention?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Something like... I'm very proud of all of that. Right? But there's another very interesting project that I think what I did after Ethereum Foundation is I started working on a project which I called Unilogin, which was another project that went nowhere. But, also, a lot of the ideas that were there are starting to come around and I think those would be super important.

What I wanted to do on Unilogin... I wanted everyone to stop using private keys for their crypto. Right? I thought that private keys was something that a user should never see. And my point was I think that everyone should have more wallets and that a private key was something that your device created, never took out of the device, and whenever you lost that device, you just replace it with another one. And so I worked for two years on smart wallets, something like that. Then at some point, we hit the wall in which creating a smart wallet will cost you $100 just to acquire a new user. We had to close down the company.

But a lot of those ideas that I spent two years talking and trying to share and trying to talk about some conferences... are becoming real because people are like... today, the word is Account Abstraction. Right? And I think it's still one of the most important things to happen if you wanted blockchains to go mainstream would be for users that never have to care about private keys again. Right? Where you just have a name and that name is connected to multiple devices and you basically use one device to allow you to use the other. Right? And I think we've... and I think we are probably reaching a moment where this will be able to be done. Right? We have not only cheaper L2s that allow you to have more wallets. We have... it's easier for you to deploy it, have already the address of a smart contract that can be deployed in all L2s at the same time. We have Passkey, which is a crypto standard that is accepted by Android and by Apple devices which is really great at logging in. And I think it's... and that's something I'm very happy to see grow on crypto. Well, yes. I am proud of all the other achievements you said.

**SPEAKER_01:**
No. Yeah. That's actually really interesting because I'm actually developing some stuff now, and my developer constantly talks to me about how big Account Abstraction is going to be for this next bull run and stuff like that. And it's really fascinating to hear that you were actually working on something like this a few years ago, was it? Or, like, in 2018. Yeah. 2018 was the first time I even talked about that. I think you were just ahead of your time, to be honest, you know. Like, that is really because it's huge when it comes to onboarding new users, quote-unquote "normies," because nobody wants to have to store their private key and worry about all that nonsense. And you were working on it back in 2018. It was just maybe the space wasn't mature enough then, and it's obviously... it wasn't to a point where now it is. And, damn, that sucks. I would really like to see maybe a Unilogin make a comeback.

**SPEAKER_02:**
I'm pretty sure thing like... all the thing that you wanted to function for will exist. I'm very happy to see them because I think it's super important for apps to reach the mainstream that we wanted want them to reach.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. No. That's great. Taking a little bit back to the beginning again, what was like your guys' main challenges and considerations when it came to the Mist Wallet and the early development of it, especially into relations to the fact that Ethereum was so early and it was still evolving? What do you guys... you know, what do you think about that? What was your biggest maybe challenges and considerations you took into place when building?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh, I think that is an interesting question that comes to the heart of what made us do the Mist wallet and why it was doomed and why it failed. Right? One of the things we really wanted was that we sort of wanted to reinvent the way the web would work. And we really wanted to make sure that every user of the Mist Wallet was also a full node. Right? Was going to be a full node on Ethereum, it was also going to be a full node on Swarm, and every app there would be hosted on Swarm. We didn't even want it to have to be for you to be able to connect to a traditional web. Right? We didn't even want you to be able to connect to a website.

The idea was that every app that you load, if you load an ENS name and that is going to connect to a Swarm node and that is going to get you download your app directly from other Mist wallet users. Right? And, also, you'll be running an Ethereum full node so that you're never dependent on anything. Right? I think we were very, like, let's say not very pragmatic about it because the reality was that it worked for a few years in 2015, 2016. It was still possible for you to run a full node in your desktop. But the reality is that by 2017, on one of the first really big major bull runs started happening, it would already take like hours and hours between downloading and actually having the wallet work.

And then almost... and then, like, most people had already migrated by MetaMask. Which MetaMask is just instant. Right? You download it. You don't need to download the new browser. You already use the browser you like. It connects directly to Etherscan, so you don't need to worry about a full node. You connect directly to the web so you don't need to worry about storing your web page or anything like that. And in the end, that's why I think one of the main reasons that Mist failed because we were sort of like dreaming too much in a way. Right? We wanted everyone to run a full node and we wanted everyone to run a fully decentralized web and that wasn't possible back then and it's still not possible today. And that is sort of how the whole project ended with no users. We had to shut it down. One of the main reasons.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That was one of my questions towards the end. I was gonna ask why you guys actually decided to sunset, but that makes sense because, you know, it is hard to get some people to interact on that level if you have to create a node and make sure the node is running correctly and everything, like, that just kinda steers some of the less technical people away.

**SPEAKER_02:**
We were able to abstract over that technical side of creating a node. Like, you didn't know you were creating a node. You just didn't know you're creating anything of that. You're just uploading. But the problem with trying to abstract a lot of things of design is that you can make a lot of things feel like magic and that's what we wanted to do. But there's a point in which you hit a technical roadblock and for most users that was when we would tell them, "Look, it's gonna take you five hours or six hours or maybe a full week before you can even use this app." Right? And there's no way to abstract about anything about that. Right? I remember actually spending hours and hours trying to work on the right mode animation to make sure that that little bar would feel that it was loading faster than was actually loading. But then, like, there's no design that can save you when the amount of time it's going to actually take is like a week. Mhmm. Right? The animation can look fancy and can have a lot of cute things, but it's gonna take a week. There's no way around that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right? There's no putting lipstick on that pig. Yeah. I think Mac was talking about that earlier in the earlier space. Mac, you can come up and say something if your mic sounds alright.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Nope. Nope. Not gonna say anything? Okay. Sounds good. I'll go to my next question.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I got a question to ask.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, okay. Yeah. Go ahead, brother.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. How's everybody doing? Good. Good. Good. Glad to have you up here. You know me as Magician, but you guys could just call me Mud. I have a question for Alex. I was gonna ask... you actually answered another question I posted in the telegram, was, what was your biggest concern as far as on the development side of how to onboard the next billion users? And I think you kinda touched on it. You said Account Abstraction, if I'm not mistaken. Another question I wanted to ask was, what's your biggest lesson that you've learned on a personal level as far as finding that balance in between doing the work, like putting your head down and just enveloping yourself into your ideas and pushing them forward and working with the team? Like, what's your biggest lesson you've learned with trying to push forward an idea you believe in, but also being receptive to other people's ideas and actually trying to find a way to make other people see your vision?

**SPEAKER_02:**
That is a great question because I think that is how we work with a team. Right? I think the best work I've ever done... and I've been working with remote teams for over ten years. Right? We... way before like Zoom was a thing and way before COVID was a thing, we were remote teams not because we wanted but rather because there was no other way to get people from all over the world to work in a single project if you have to fly everyone to the same place. And we had to work remotely. And part of the challenge of working remotely is that you have a lot of time for you alone to be working, like, without anyone over your shoulder to check what you're doing. But then you need to have full conversations with people. And those conversations, it's not about you pushing your idea and then or accepting the idea of someone else and guessing who wins. But it's really about trying to find a common place.

I think in those discussions, the ideas get better. Often and often, the way it would work is as I sort of mentioned that... I would have an idea, and Fabian would have a different idea, and we would fight over this idea. But on the argument, every time he would make an argument against my idea I would come back and say, "Look, yeah, but if we change this then that solves that." And then he was, "No, no, but if change this other thing my idea is better." But on those arguments, what we were doing was actually hitting each other's idea and modifying it to a point in which at some point in the middle, we were like, "Yeah. I think that works." And it was almost as if we were beating each other's idea until it fell in the middle, which was a much more strong idea and something that felt like it belonged to both of us. Right? He never felt at any moment that I was giving up on something that I really believed on or that I was forcing him to give up on his idea. It felt like we were both, by debating it, we were both owning the thing, and we were reaching something that was probably better than anything that we both could think of.

I think Steve Jobs uses the term which I think it's fantastic in which you have to have "strong beliefs loosely held." Meaning that like you really should believe the things you like, you must be very passionate about your own beliefs, but also be very... you should drop them very easily whenever you see something better come along. Right?

**SPEAKER_03:**
It's interesting. Thank you for the answer you gave. You actually answered a few questions I had in mind. I think it's very valuable information for anybody who's attempting to promote or push forward an idea, but also trying to work in a team.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. For sure. Yeah. And thinking about that, it's always important. Right? A lot of the work I did often as a designer was that I was just trying to communicate to the developers the thing that I was seeing that the users needed. And sometimes I was trying to communicate to final users the thing that the developer wanted to build that couldn't be understood. So as a designer, I felt I was constantly translating from those worlds. Right? I was looking at something that developers wants to build... this thing... nobody understands what it is. I would translate it to, like, an end user. And then I would advocate for the end user saying, "Hey. This is how we are gonna build this thing for them." And I think being that portion in between is super important. And often, what you do a lot is just trying to communicate and having convincing people that this is a good thing worth building.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I appreciate that question, Mud, because even though it's a bit of a situation with me, but I'm dealing with the same thing when it comes to trying to find a healthy, positive, collaborative environment instead of being at each other's neck and trying to figure out who's right or what's the best way to go. Sometimes, the collaborative, you know, there needs to be a sense of positivity and realize that all the end goal is the same for everybody. You know, how we get there is... that's how you work together and figure out what's the best way to approach that problem. You know, it's tough to work with teams, especially remote. You're not there to see people's reactions in person and judge body language. It's tough at times.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. And you have to listen. Right? If you feel that your ideas are pure beauty and genius and that everyone is trying to ruin it, you're probably not a very good team member and probably your ideas aren't that great. Right? You have to have humility and then understand that other people also have good ideas on how to improve your thing.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, and nowadays with this culture, some of these crypto Twitter people and stuff like that, it's very... there's a lot of arrogance that everybody thinks they know it all. And if you can't take a step back and see that you don't know it all and you never will know it all, you're better off as a team because you guys connect... you can actually take that criticism and take those other ideas and mesh it into one like you're saying. And now it's not just one idea, it's everybody's idea and everybody put in the time or effort, and now they all feel kinda emotionally connected to that idea. Yeah. No. That was a great question, Mud. Especially as I'm dealing with that stuff on my own building, it's really nice to hear something like that.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Can you hear me now about insurance?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think we have time for one last question. Can you hear me well? Yeah. Yeah. We could hear you. Do you wanna ask the final question? I was gonna try to go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. I'll be just quick.

**SPEAKER_04:**
So I think you mentioned, Alex, that there was a lot of attempts to do essentially chain wallets and stuff. I know that the ETH Swarm team was working quite early on, like Daniel and some other guys like Ethereum on an on-chain wallet called `eth-login`. Have you... were you familiar with that one? It wasn't that early, but it was something that I also came across and did a little bit of work on probably two years ago. And second small question, the Parity wallet came out just after Mist wallets. Was that an attempt to solve the issue with the syncing of a whole node? Because I remember that that one, there was statements that they would try and run that on like a light client and only sync a portion of the chain.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So I worked with Daniël Nagy, if that's the same person. He went also on the forum. Yeah. I don't remember his work on `login`. That's interesting. Not sure what it meant by, like, on-chain wallets.

The Parity light client thing. Like, since I was working with you and they were always like claims that, "Yeah, this light client sync or this new light client sync is going to be the one that solves all light clients problem." Right? So there's always... and there's... and I still don't think there's a very good way to really have a fully decentralized light client that can just connect to it. Right? First of all, because it's hard to do it.

And often, and that's just even sadder, is that often the user doesn't really care. That software is a big problem always. Often the user... like, if you say, "Look, instead of taking like one gigabyte, 10 gigabyte, the thing is gonna take a 100 megabytes." And the user is like, "Why do I even wanna use this to a 100 megabytes if I can just connect to Etherscan or whatever?" And then that's never good enough for a user. Yeah. Tough. So, yeah, "user didn't care" is an epitaph for a thousand decentralized projects everywhere.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Awesome. Thank you for answering that. I tagged you in a comment with the repo that I was talking about. And, yes, it was Daniel from ETH Swarm. I did a bit of work with them two years ago.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Alex, I got one question for you just so you have time to plug here what you're working on. I saw that you're working on a new project called the High Order Company. Can you explain to us a bit about what that is, you know, what the goals is, and just talk about what you're currently working on? And after that, I just appreciate your time and stuff.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Sure. I am working both in two fronts. I am working a lot on ENS, on meta-governance for ENS and for DAOs in general. I think it's super important to think about governance. And I still think that one of the main impacts that blockchain can do today is to have decentralized companies or organizations where all the funds are trackable and everything is transparent. And I'm very proud to see that ENS is I would say one of the best examples of that.

The second thing I work a lot... I mean, working on... one of the smartest people I've worked with during my time with Ethereum Foundation, I'm not saying a lot because I did work with a lot of smart people, was a guy named Victor... Victor Tyler. Victor Maya, then he goes by Victor Tyler right now [Victor Taelin]. And he worked on the Mist wallet and he was like... I would often ask him to do a task, "Hey, can you just integrate this library with Swarm for a bit?" And he was like, two, three days later he was, "Yeah, the work is done, but I need some more time because I found an upstream bug on the library." And then three days later, he was, "Yeah, I fixed the library, but I think the library is having the wrong approach. Give me a few days. I'm gonna make a new library for that." And then I gave him a few days more, and he was like, "You know, I've created a new library, but I think the real problem is that Mist is using the wrong thing. We should really refactor Mist as a whole to do the thing." And at some point, I joked with him, "Victor, I can't give you more time. I know that if you just have all the time in the world, you would just want to build a whole fucking new computer." And he was like, "Yeah. You're right. I will."

Well, guess what? Victor has all the time in the world now and he's actually building a new computer and he just figured out a way to... like, he's been studying computer science history and he found a way to create a view of the computers [that] are much more parallel and can execute faster and a lot of things like that. And I think it is fantastic. And it's even... and it's one of those things that is very hard to communicate what they are doing, but I think they are doing something that is going to be big, which is why I like working with them because part of what I work there is just trying to explain to people what they are doing. We are working on a new website. It's gonna be very cool. You're gonna have to have very be able to see some animations. Within ENS, you know, we are all using Turing machines. And he's like, "Look. Turing machines are wrong. There are better ways to do it instead of having this concept of a Turing machine, which is like a little robot with infinite tape that goes back and forth and changes the tapes from zero to one." He's able to turn any sort of computation into basically a planar graph with a thousand lines. And those lines have like four little commands that they can do and they can do it all at the same time. So you can run it in eight, sixteen cores at the same time and it just becomes a very easy way to transform any computation [into] something that is multicore all the time. So, yeah, you should... if you think this sounds interesting, you should definitely follow the HVM page.

**SPEAKER_01:**
How do I profit off this? How do I invest in this?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well, you should follow us. If you wanna be a pioneer yourself, maybe you can participate on that somehow. Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I would like to be a pioneer like you, Alex. I really would. Is is that the High Order Company, or is that something else? Yeah. Okay. I'm definitely gonna check that out and do some research in it because that sounds amazing, and it sounds like the guy you got on board is definitely one of those those genius pioneers that you don't come across very often. So...

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah. You should definitely follow up.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I'm gonna look into that. I wholeheartedly really appreciate you, Alex, jumping on here. Maybe we could do it again in some times because I still have, like, 20 other questions I wanna ask you. But and I know there's other people here too that wanted to come up, but it's been about an hour and I don't wanna take too much of your time. So thank you so much, and I really, truly, truly do appreciate it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well, thank you for the invitation, and it was fun to have this conversation.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, man. Have a good day. We'll probably stay on for a little bit and chat it up. So you're more than like... you're welcome to go head out and do whatever you gotta do, and thanks, man.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Great. Thank you, everyone. Have a good one. Bye.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. That's great. That was great. How much longer are you gonna stay on?

**SPEAKER_01:**
I don't know. I was just kinda letting him dip out to see what everybody thought. I thought that was really super, super... you know...

**SPEAKER_03:**
Nice job, bro. Informative. Yeah. You really held it down. Good job.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I mean, I had a whole list of stuff I wanted to make sure I asked him, and I only got through, like, half of it. I would have been on here for another hour, but I appreciate it. Nonetheless, bro. Nonetheless. Yeah. No. Yeah. That was it was really good. I wanna do this every Monday. So, yeah, I'm in in the chat as Ascension Guide. So if I was thinking about making a little bit of a, like, a telegram group. So if anybody wants to, you know, shoot me a PM, my PMs are open, you know, which is not the smartest thing to do, but my PMs are open. So shoot me a PM. Like, I could get whoever wants to jump on here and or, you know, maybe have some topics that they have and they want for the next Mist Monday. Like, I wanna do this every Monday. I wanna start building the community to get to a point where, you know, we're having people actually engage rather than just, you know, waiting for a number go up, which is great and stuff. And I love Mist, but I think there's a lot of opportunity here when it comes to community building or even just, you know, building in general. Like, this is one of the older... this is the oldest ERC-20, the first ERC-20 in all of Ethereum. There's a lot of cool things that we could do with this. We just need to make that community a bit, you know, tight knitted and have a little bit more than just financial sense, which I all know we're here to watch the number go up. But...

**SPEAKER_03:**
Number go up, bro.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That's it. Number go up. But it's actually fun, man. It's fun developing. I was... you know, me and Victor who leads the Discord and runs the social media. We were here since October, and we kinda pushed to get Mist, you know, the liquidity sufficient enough to start getting people to be able to buy and take part. And it's been a crazy journey, man, about a lot of ups and downs.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yo. About that... about that, I don't mean to cut you off, but you... About the liquidity. So I saw that this is on Base now, which is amazing. I think that's a great opportunity for new users to get some exposure. Is is it bridged or is it just an...

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think there's, like... It's bridged, but the liquidity is very, very small because a lot of people haven't really bridged over. So what we were planning to do is what I was gonna talk to Alex about, but we didn't get enough time is there was actually a Doge-ETH bridge that Ethereum was planning back in, like, 2017. And there was 50,000 Mist valued at about a million dollars that were sent to this Doge kind of bounty because it was a bounty. So I was like, whoever can make a bridge between Doge and ETH, do you have a bounty? And it was like a shit ton of ETH. And the Mist was kind of just thrown in there as, I don't know, a joke or something. I don't know. That's what I was gonna ask him about. I was like, who kind of thought about sending that?

So, there's actually some crazy signers on there, like Alex. Don't know. I think Fabian, but Vitalik is on there as a signer. Like, there's a lot of big names on there as signers. If we could somehow get the attention of enough signers to go ahead and unlock that 50k Mist coin, we could have... okay. Here's Victor. Hold on one second. We could have potentially enough to bridge over to Base, maybe do a little bit of, like, a DAO incentive things because there is a DAO for Mistcoin that I set up, via Snapshot, and then go ahead and maybe pay out some developers for building cool things on top of Mist. Like, that 50k would be very, very valuable if we could somehow snatch it up. But... What's going on, Victor? Oh, yeah. My bad.

**SPEAKER_00:**
No. You're good.

**SPEAKER_05:**
Yes, Austin. First of all, congratulation for this initiative. I think that's great. Please keep it up because I think that this Mist Monday is something that we we need to keep. Secondly, about the liquidity in Base. Just remember, guys, that Uniswap pools are permissionless. No? So everybody's free to pool their own liquidity. And at the end of the day, I mean, if everybody, let's say, pools like a 10% of their holdings of Mist or 5% or just a tiny amount, at the end, the liquidity there will be more healthy, and we will progressively be building more liquidity in Base. You know? I mean, maybe now we don't have too much volume there because the liquidity is tiny, so nobody would be interested in trading there. No. But it's something like progressively. You know? The more people pulling liquidity there, the more volume we will have there and think that we will have more exposure there eventually. So I think that maybe waiting for releasing these tokens of Doge DAO, maybe it will take time. So maybe we can do this commingled effort of providing some liquidity by ourselves. Note that well, you know, the gas fees now in the mainnet are very low. So, well, I think that everybody can afford to do a swap in mainnet because the wei this morning, I guess, was in seven, six points or something like that. So it's not too expensive.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Do you know who created the Base side... the Base side Mist coin? Essentially, the bridge.

**SPEAKER_05:**
Yeah. It's me, but well, there is a tool in Base called Base Migrate. So everybody is free to do that. It's very simple. It's just two or three steps, and you have, like, a tutorial developed by the Base guys. So everybody's free to do the same with any Ethereum Mainnet token. It just takes, like, thirty minutes to the whole process and later on, like, five, six days to have the pull request in GitHub approved.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. Yeah. I actually was speaking about the on the earlier... on the earlier space, I was saying how Base is really, really popping off and how L2s have made it really, really easy for for... I mean, lots of different use cases. But surely, we don't need liquidity for... we only need liquidity of Mist tokens if they want to bridge back from Base to Ethereum. Right? Because if you want it... well, it depends on how the bridge is set up. But if you're bridging from Ethereum Mainnet to Base, you essentially are minting a new token on the Base side. And in that way, you could basically... it's ready for you. So anybody who wants to bridge from Ethereum just bridges it, mints the new token on Base, but, obviously, bridging it back from Base to Ethereum would require more liquidity.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I think it locks up. It locks up that Mist, and that's why it's only one specific bridge. I don't think there's multiple bridges. So if you lock your Mist in that contract, it mints the Base token, and then you put that Base back in there and unlocks the Mist that, you know, whatever amount it was and stuff like that. So that yeah.

**SPEAKER_04:**
The supply can only be as high as how many people locked up in that initial ETH bridge. Yeah. So the liquidity is just that we want liquidity just in case we wanna bridge back from Base. Anybody who has Mist, we don't... you can just go ahead and bridge across.

**SPEAKER_05:**
Yes. Yeah. I was referring just to the liquidity in Uniswap just in case you want to do some swaps from Ether in Base to Mist in Base. Just that as I was saying, I mean, you don't need a liquidity in both sides to make the bridge... the bridge work in such a way that once you bridge one token from Mainnet to the Base side, I mean, it's like frozen. It's like locked.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we need more liquidity providers is what you're saying.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I have a suggestion. Right? What does everybody think about maybe because, you know, there's like a meme mania right now, and people are throwing their money at all types of... I mean, pretty much bullshit. Right? And this narrative that we're looking at right now, we're dealing with this pretty much like... I mean, it sells itself. I'm just speaking from an investor standpoint. Right? So if liquidity is the goal, what does everybody think about maybe us, ourselves, instead of waiting for like the Doge unlocking that 50k, that'll be good. But instead of like waiting or while we wait on that, I mean, something that we could maybe possibly do if everybody's up for it, maybe we could start, I don't know, maybe our own our own token or something, deploy it. Some of us add some liquidity to that, get it up off the ground. But X token has the sole and explicit purpose of, I don't know, maybe bringing more attention to Mist itself and the Relic meta itself, and maybe, I don't know, a portion of fees generated or money made can go towards explicitly to providing liquidity to the pool.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. It's... I mean, it's interesting. I mean, in...

**SPEAKER_03:**
I think a lot of people... You know, just something because, you know, we can take advantage of the fact that there's so many people, especially on this new chain because like Base that are just buying whatever the like, whatever the hell. This is actually... I don't know the how the mechanics would work, but it essentially that's how like the experience would go. Like, we're all in on it. We know what's up. We're already doing what we can. I see a few of us are already, like, you know, reposting stuff and posting memes and doing what we can to, like, you know, get it out there and get attention and market it and that's, like, amazing. But just an idea, you know, just so we can get some, like, new money in and we can actually use that for something and as a community, we all agree. You know what I mean? Full transparency, no rug bullshit. I don't know. Just something... think it's maybe it sounds gimmicky, but I don't know. Sometimes gimmicks work and, you know, people always wanna put their money in things. So that that's just where my head was at.

**SPEAKER_04:**
I would just caution against creating a new token willy nilly because, you know, a lot of people forget. There's a lot of legal things that come into it, you know. So, like, you...

**SPEAKER_03:**
Legal, it's good. You could kinda say it's you're just splintering liquidity.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yes. No. No. No. Not just that. It's regulation. Right? So if, you know, to launch a token, like, the proper way, you have to make sure that like you, you know, understand the legalities in different jurisdictions because... and lot of people just don't do this because they're like, whatever. You know? But, you know, it can really come bite your back in the ass if, you know, like, hey, you launched a token, and then, you know, the SEC comes knocking. And remember, you're opening up yourself up to every single jurisdiction because it's blockchain unless you actually say you can't trade this token in these jurisdictions. Like, you know, certain platforms, can't. As an American, you can't use it.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I I I see where you're going with it. I see where you're going. And that's definitely something that would be at the forefront is the legality of it because, you know, nobody really has time to deal with that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
What I was thinking is properly, I should say... If we could... I mean, I kinda am starting this with, like, my blockchain historical society and stuff is trying to get our hands on old relics and then potentially using those as like a reward system for supplying liquidity or something like that. Like, there's a lot of different ways we can go about it and still kinda not launch our own token, but find a way to reward those that add liquidity or... there's a lot of different ways about things. And I've actually reached out to some people, and got ahold of via just really digging into the blockchain and of some old developers that were launching tokens and stuff like that. So...

**SPEAKER_03:**
It could be NFT. It could be a lot of different things for...

**SPEAKER_01:**
A buddy of mine. His name's like T Scurver or something like that on Twitter, and he wrapped a bunch of XCOPY NFTs into ERC-20 tokens, and they're pretty, yeah, they're pretty big. I mean, his last time I checked his the market cap was, like, you know, anywhere between like 5 to 10 mil. And it's just... he just wrapped old... or not old, but art from XCOPY in it. And just because XCOPY is like a historical artist that has a big following, like, it makes it easier to trade it rather than like an NFT and stuff.

**SPEAKER_03:**
A fractional... like, somebody could get a fractional amount of that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. They could. I think yeah. They I think you can as well. But they're like... It's something that I feel like people in the community would really bite and go for just because it has to do with, like, Mist. So the legality thing of like a actual token, I agree with that.

**SPEAKER_03:**
But something just anything that could... something that could, like, people who are already invested in this can feel like, you know, they're a part of something or they they had got exclusive access to something because they're a holder. Right. You know what I mean? Which starts there. And then from there, we build out. Yeah. No. I mean... more liquidity. Attention and liquidity. Education.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, I think a good way to be able to rep that you had own Mist could be smart, whether it be a PFP or something like that. Like, see how you guys were talking about those badges earlier?

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. Back in the day badges. Same thing with like the dude from Bankless, like with the with the POAP. You know, the POAP? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Things like that. You know what I'm saying? Like, something similar to that, and that could have a whole bunch of that could open up a whole bunch of other, you know, doors to that could lead back to the thing you were talking about of the DAO or society about the relics and, you know, collecting and stuff like that. It leads back to one another.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I think there's a huge, huge market for this, these relics and stuff. And I'm, like, you know, I'm not gonna go through and show any relics or anything like that. But there's a huge, you know, like, with any market, you know, even like video games and stuff, like people are paying top dollar for the old early video games, you know, the ones that came out, some of the first ones. Like, you have some of those in mint condition, you know, people are spending tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for some of those things. You know, why is crypto only different? Especially, it's a... in the fact of crypto is, like, one year in crypto is, like, ten years, you know. Like, that's how fast it kinda moves. So, like, I really see a huge opportunity in these early tokens, these early NFTs. I think like a PFP or something, which is something that I was kinda working on for Mist, or another token that I was gonna move over to Mist. The only thing is I kinda wanted to like do it for free, you know, or you locked up x amount of Mist, and you got your token, you got an NFT. If you don't want your NFT anymore, you burned it and you got your Mist back. But it could be... we could do a certain percentage or fee just to build up a little bit of whether it be a treasury or some liquidity to move over to Base because seeding Base liquidity would be really, really great.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Just... That was my point. Yeah. We need we should do that. That was, like, the crux of what I was getting at, really. It just needs to be tasteful because you don't wanna dilute...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Of course. What we have here. Like, the... like, whether Mist has liquidity on Base or not, like, I'm in my opinion, this is not financial advice, it doesn't matter. At some point, Mist is gonna come across the right eyes, and this thing is gonna blow the fuck up. Now it would have been nice to have an, you know, nice liquidity on two chains just to give other people options. You know, ETH will be at some point... It is hot right now. On... you know, unusable. You know, at some point, it will not be unusable, but very expensive to use on, and that will drive a lot of people away. So it would be nice to get, you know, another chain functional with, you know, cheaper gas.

**SPEAKER_03:**
And people like meme... people love memes.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. No. BASE is... I have some questions about BASE on, you know, some things they said, like, you know, if something did go down, I think they would bend the knee to the SEC. And if you don't fucking give up your information, you won't be able to bridge out or something like that. It's always a possibility.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. I see them hand out Wells notices and stuff. Like, I've been seeing that. I don't even know what that is, but it's probably like... The Wells notice? Yeah. Oh, it's just pretty much like in layman's terms, it's kinda like a forewarning of or like a chance. That's like that's like what the SEC gives companies like, "Hey. Just just a heads up, we figure you're doing something that falls out of bounds of the law." Yeah. And this is your chance, so this is your, like, acknowledgement. This is your chance to realize we're on you pretty much or, like, something's coming. Is...

**SPEAKER_04:**
It's not an official charge. It's just kinda like a notice. Yeah. They're essentially saying they're saying that, you know, we are coming we are going to take you to court for x and x for x and y, and you should start preparing your defense. Right? Prepare...

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. So it's intent... it intend to prosecute. With Robinhood. I've seen it with some other exchanges. So what you just said about Base, yes, that is also something that we should think about, you know, focusing too much of our eggs in that Base basket. I just figured Base because only because of the popularity, but, yes, that is also a concern that I think about as well. I mean...

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. Base is pretty safe, purely because it is Coinbase, and Coinbase has actually gone through the rigmarole with the SEC. Think that it's may it could be there could be more right now, but it's like Coinbase is, like, the only one that's is is, like, backed. Like, it's fair to that. It's insured, essentially. So they went through that whole process, which is good. But yeah. I mean, if you didn't know, Joe [Lubin] from ConsenSys is actually taking the SEC to court because of all this all these Wells notices to to different companies like like Uniswap. See that. Yeah. It's great.

**SPEAKER_01:**
What's wrong? Gary [Gensler] didn't get, you know, didn't get the job at Binance, so now he's all salty and just throwing notices at everybody. Fucking I can't... I have no...

**SPEAKER_04:**
I have no idea. They're going off the MetaMask. They're going they they they're going back on...

**SPEAKER_03:**
All the wallets. They're they're it's like they're trying to just it's like Operation Chokepoint. We're still in it. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_04:**
They're basically they're basically trying to now say, hey. You know, it is a security even though they've gone through... like, the the same people who are saying that it's not a security have actually, like, you know, stated that it is a... what do you call it? Commodity in the past. They're trying to say that MetaMask and other wallets are broker... broker... what's it called? Broker-dealer.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Broker-dealers. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Which is absolutely insane. They're kind of just the terminology for broker-dealer is just not good enough.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Crazy. Yeah. It it it they they they I think everybody should go look that up right now. Yeah. Yeah. They're basically hanging off the definition of facilitation. So, like, they're saying, "Oh, but it facilitates." You know? But the fact is it's a piece of it's a it's an application, and it can't... it can't, like, execute without you pushing a button. So in the same sense that they're calling it a facilitator, you can say that, "Okay. Cool. Well, Apple and Windows and, you know, Microsoft should also be in this in this, you know, what do you call it, court case because they're also facilitating these things. They're facilitating in the same way that MetaMask is."

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. I wouldn't worry about I wouldn't worry about, like, you know, regulations for token, like, a bridge token because the onus is that you're bridging... the origin is the Mist, and none of us here are the creator of Mist. So and that would basically just be like opening up making a case against a token that has already gone through the rigmarole. So, you know, I don't think we worry about bridge wild precedent.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. I see where you're going.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Well, every single bridge token would also need to then doubly kind of, like, prove itself, which is ridiculous. But Mhmm. I like the idea of of an extra kind of, like, it almost like a marketing campaign, like a onboarding campaign. There's I'm gonna also think about it and chat to you, AC, about I think we have the power to do it with with the amount of people that are already interested in Mist because of the just, like, the whole Relic meta thing.

Like, it's not just about price go up. Like, I think the biggest thing that attracted me to it was just not the marketability of Mist itself due to the providence and the history and the associations, but how I'm literally in real time seeing OGs, like, ETH OGs, like, you know, kinda like double back, like because it's, like, it's kinda, like it's, like, a callback to, like, original the community, you know, before before the 2021 blow off top, before meme coin mania, before Solana, before all that shit, like, the OG feel, like, how it was back in the day. Like, people have something that they can actually call back to. Literally, it's what it's called a callback, like in in in in writing or if if anybody writes screenplays or anything like that or has anything to do with entertainment, a callback is kinda like, or like in a joke, a callback is like, you know, you're literally referring back to something else that was said. I feel like Mist is kinda like a callback to a time. You know what I mean? Like a vibe on Ethereum that people can actually see. Plus the timestamp thing is super, super, super smart. I don't know who came up with that, but that's really good. That's that's that's really good. Mhmm. Even even even It embodies what I'm what I'm trying to get across.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Even Alex said that. And Alex is like Alex is like like, I'm not fudding or anything like that, but Alex is like, he's still kinda, like, just blown back at what Mist has become. He did not expect it to get to this point, which is fine. You know, he he was just building and he ended up building something great.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Trying to give him the flowers, bro, and he was like, no. Have to. No. He's he's just a he's what he is. He's just like a builder. Humble. He's builder.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. He's a he's a good good guy. I've I've had a couple, like, conversations with him outside of the the space, but he just, yeah. He he he wants to build and make good things and, the the whole unicorn like, that's one token I will talk about because he brought it up. The unicorn token is super cool. Really, really super cool, but it's, like, impossible to get your hands on. Like, that would be potentially something that would be really, really cool to give, as, like, a reward or something if you, like, locked up some Mist, but it's, like, impossible. They're, like, so...

**SPEAKER_03:**
I like where you're going with that though, like, stuff like that, you know?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I think that falls in the line and then also it kind of gives us a bit of leeway when it comes to litigation because we didn't start these tokens. We're just giving them out. You know what I'm saying? Like, we didn't actually, you know, launch these tokens. So if we were able to get our hands on some of them and just, like, give them out for free, not even necessarily, like, set a value behind it or anything or, you know, even make a liquidity pool, it's still, you're getting these old, you know, relic tokens.

You know? At some some at some point, somebody would probably make a pool and do a whole bunch of stuff and start an initiative and grow a community just like we did with Mist. You know? Like, that's what's fucking great about this is, like, anybody could step up and do anything for whatever token it may be, whether it be a actual token that's a relic or something that was innovative of the time. Maybe it's not 2017. Maybe it's not 2018 or, you know, maybe it's 2019. Maybe it's 2020. Like, that's still, like, you know, of, you know, four or five years ago, like, the the space was much different then than it is now. I mean, look at ENS swap came around in 2020, and that was one of the, you know, probably one of the greatest crypto related tech advancements of our time. The fact that liquidity pools could be made and anybody could trade any token and doesn't really need much liquidity behind it. Like, that was, you know, huge, and that was just created in 2020. If you really think about it, like, we are still so early in the tech development, you know, in the days of the, you know, the tech development, how farther we can go. You know, at some point, like, with Account Abstraction, you're gonna get to a point where you're not even you're using crypto, and you're not even using it, and you don't even know you're using it. You know? It's like and that's when we're gonna see the normies, you know, normal people start to get involved, and they're not even gonna know that they're using crypto. But on the back end, they are, and then that's when you're gonna see the explosion. That's when you're still gonna see Bitcoin hitting half $2,000,000 because the adoption is there. You know? I mean...

**SPEAKER_04:**
Is this turning into DAO? There was there was Bancor and 0x Protocol in 2017. So, I mean, they were on-chain, you know, swapping facilities for a long time. But Uniswap just...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Don't don't fud me, dude.

**SPEAKER_04:**
No. No. No. No. Points. I'm not I'm not fudding. What I'm saying is that Uniswap just Uniswap just did it really, really well. You know what I mean? They they really did a a great job, and one thing that they did was they they had their their code open source. They also what do you call it? They they they iterated really, really quickly with V2. They, you know, they they did really did do they did something, though, that was quite different.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah. They they innovated. Yeah. Yeah. For sure.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I'm I'm excited about, you know, so I have V4 too with the whole hooks thing and everything. Like, I was thinking about, you know, how to build on top of the hooks. I'm not a developer. I just kinda think of things in development ways and try to, you know, figure out a way to make cool stuff. But Uniswap, they did their thing for sure, and, yeah, they definitely changed the game. 0x had liquidity pools like that. I thought they just had, like, a straight up DEXs.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Bancor, 0x. They I think in the early days, I think 0x did have.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I don't know, dude. I think Uniswap made the LP. I think Uniswap came up with the LP idea.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. You might be right. But...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I remember trading on, like, which was they use 0x. I'm pretty sure. And that was, like, 2019. That was, like, when all the fucking burn tokens came out, which I think there's actually, you know, potentially some opportunity there and stuff, some deflationary tokens, you know, with this whole inflationary shit going on. But yeah. No. It's it's been a it's been a crazy past... I've been only I've been in the game for, like, eight, eight, nine years, so crazy to see how far it's came.

But, I think that if anybody is interested and and wants to make a telegram group, just please message me, on telegram at AscensionGuide. I'm I'm in the I'm in the chat, you know, all the time and and post and stuff. So just please shoot me a PM, and I'll make a Mist Monday's private telegram where we could talk about, you know, potentially topics or maybe special guests or what we could do. And, you know, I really think that this Mist Mondays could be built up to a really you know, to have a lot of a lot of listeners in the futures and especially the way as as Mist coin grows and and gets more people in front of it. Like, this is the this is the space to come and talk and shoot the shit, you know, potentially bring on other partners or whatever it may be and, you know, just continue to grow this Relic space because the the more that the Relic space grows, you know, the bigger opportunity it is for Mist. So I'm probably gonna wrap it up there, guys. Anybody that, you know, wants to shoot me a PM, you're more than welcome. I appreciate everybody jumping on. I think Alex had a lot of great things to say. Yeah. I I'm excited for the future.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Appreciate you, man. Thanks for the time, bro.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. For sure. I'll see you guys potentially next Monday. I wanna do this every Monday, but at the very least, like, every couple Mondays. So I'll keep everybody posted in the chat and Mist telegram, and, yeah, we'll, we'll talk there. Thanks, everybody.
