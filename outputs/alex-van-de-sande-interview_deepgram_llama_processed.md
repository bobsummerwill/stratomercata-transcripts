[00:08] Good to see the faces piling in.

[00:18] Alex, good to have you here, man.
[00:20] Appreciate it.
[00:22] If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions, just feel free to raise your hand.

[00:24] Kinda.
[00:26] Kinda a bit, like, underwater.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:28] Is Victor out here?
[00:30] No.
[00:32] Victor.
[00:34] Okay.
[00:36] Let me see.
[00:38] Just give us a few moments, guys, trying to set this up.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:44] Cartoons, you wanna come up?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:46] I'll invite you.
[00:48] Even if you're just on a panel, you don't gotta speak.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:50] You are here for episode zero.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:52] But you got you, Mac.
[00:54] Wishing my phone wasn't so dumb.
[00:56] I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:58] You should sing, AG.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:00] Who's who said that?
[01:02] Alex?
[01:04] Hey.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:06] Hey.
[01:08] You should play some live music.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:10] I was playing some classical music, but, yeah, I don't know.
[01:12] It's good to have you on here.
[01:14] I'm glad the mic's all working out now.
[01:16] I really appreciate you jumping on.
[01:18] It's been an interesting six months for sure.
[01:20] So, really, I just wanna kinda just pick your brain a bit about about the past, honestly.
[01:22] Like, more than just, you know, Miss Coin in general, but really just, like, how you got all started with, you know, the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot.
[01:24] So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum and what was your kind of first initial reaction to it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:26] Sure.
[01:28] I have to say, my wife thinks it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now.
[01:30] So, I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's fun.
[01:32] So, I think so, I started being interested in making Bitcoin around 2012.
[01:34] So, that was like, it feels like a long time ago.
[01:36] It feels like the early days, but for me, I already felt like, oh god, I missed it.
[01:38] They're already talking about Bitcoin on The Good Wife on live TV.
[01:40] I'm like, oh no.
[01:42] But, like, he used to be under a dollar.
[01:44] Now it's $10.
[01:46] Damn, I so missed Bitcoin.
[01:48] Right?
[01:50] That's too bad.
[01:52] I even remember, like, I posted something on the forum saying, oh no, I tried buying Bitcoin at $5, I paid, it was so hard, and then someone simply, like, I think, tipped me, like, 5 Bitcoin on Reddit, saying, hey, here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin.
[01:54] And it was, like, back then, I don't know, like, probably a full Bitcoin.
[01:56] Right?
[01:58] So, like, Bitcoin was $5 back then.
[02:00] So, that was those early days.
[02:02] Uh-huh.
[02:04] Again, didn't feel too early.
[02:06] And then I started paying attention because I felt that I knew someone bigger would come for Bitcoin.
[02:08] And I just started following all sorts of projects, like Mastercoin and things like that.
[02:10] Uh-huh.
[02:12] And so, I found Ethereum, and I was, wow, I was so blown away and captivated that I couldn't think of anything else.
[02:14] And I, the people were still very active on the Reddit, like, would answer questions personally.
[02:16] And then I just started helping out on the forum, on the Reddit, I'm a designer, I'm not a coder, so I thought, hey, like, there are enough coders here, maybe they need this, maybe the designer, and then someone would ask something for a presentation, I could give them.
[02:18] And then, by the time that the presale rolled around, they started having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list.
[02:20] So, that's how I got started working with some crazy people.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:22] So, you did not, like, expect to be so heavily involved and become the pioneer that you did.
[02:24] You were just kind of jumping in and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really.
[02:26] You didn't expect it to blow up like this.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:28] I certainly didn't expect it to, like, sort of, yes and no, because I felt that back then, it was, it seemed very obvious that he was going to be a big thing, and I was like, I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this.
[02:30] I was like, can't I, I, I felt like telling everybody I knew, can't you see, look at this shit, this is crazy, it's like a blockchain, but it's a computer inside, and people were like, think, like, people were acting as, as crazy, acting so as crazy.
[02:32] I, I, I was a founder of a company back then, I, I was doing, like, an iPhone app, sort of, like, Instagram for fashion list, and I had raised money with, like, but the app wasn't going anywhere, and I realized that I wasn't, I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app, I was just thinking about it all the time.
[02:34] And then I told my friends that I, I wanted to leave this, they were like, are you, like, leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old that's going to pay you in, like, make-up money that he invented?
[02:36] I was like, yeah, sure, that seems like a great idea.
