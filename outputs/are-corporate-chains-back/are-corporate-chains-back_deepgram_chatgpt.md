**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** The stream is live. The stream is live.

**[00:03] SPEAKER_01:** Don't cross the streams.

**[00:05] SPEAKER_02:** Who are you gonna call? We'll see what happens to the audio when you cross the streams. Yes. Exactly. Okay. We seem to be also live on X. So welcome everyone to another group chat for the...

**[00:14] SPEAKER_01:** Mutual support group chat. Mutual support group. Yeah. Of fairness.

**[00:17] SPEAKER_02:** Yes. Exactly. With the builders from Straum. I'm Victor Wong. I am founder and chief product officer at Straum Mercado.

**[00:24] SPEAKER_01:** Bob, who are you? Hello. I'm head of ecosystem.

**[00:27] SPEAKER_02:** And Karen, who are you?

**[00:29] SPEAKER_00:** Karen James. Once a coder, you know, long time off. Code a little again. Vibe coding era has been great for making an occasional fix here and there.

**[00:38] SPEAKER_02:** But soon, soon, we'll be back just doing commercial stuff. You know? I was playing around with the OpenAI browser today, and it was kind of miraculous just telling it to do stuff and seeing the cursor move around. It was both miraculous and disturbing. You know? Yeah. Client good at that, though it moves really slow. It does. It takes time to do stuff. But you just can't keep it running in the background. Anyways, today's topic, getting us back to the topic at hand, is basically: are corporate chains back? And we obviously have some intimate knowledge about this, having been part of the rise and perhaps fall and maybe the rise again of corporate chains. Hey. Hey, Lewis. Nice to have you. But maybe you can—maybe, Bob, you can give us an outline of the new corporate chains as they're called. Like, what's kind of happening currently? And then we can kind of look back over the history of corporate chains.

**[01:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, the red hot action at the moment is really about Tempo. You know? So Tempo was announced on September 4 by Stripe and a consortium that they got together, which—just reading initial members as well as Stripe themselves—included Anthropic, Coupang—I don't know who those are, I'm not gonna sell these—Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Mercury Bank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, and Visa. So, yeah, I mean, you got Shopify and Visa. You know, you're doing pretty well on that payment side.

**[01:56] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[01:57] SPEAKER_01:** And, yeah, I mean, I guess where a lot of this tension has come in on the Ethereum side is, you know, this is gonna be another EVM chain. So it's kind of like, thanks for the work, guys. We'll do a corporate version now. And, you know, specifically, Paradigm are a big part of this. Now Paradigm have spent the last few years kind of building up Ethereum stack stuff, kind of being semi well-behaved participants within the Ethereum ecosystem, coming out of a few VC-nasty moments, but essentially building a, you know, "Hey, we've built a really good new Rust client," right? "We do some of the best tooling with Foundry," right? You know, what we had going on in earlier years, right? We've made a better one, and I think there's about three or four areas where they built sort of Ethereum stack stuff. Almost like, "Hey, here's a full-stack Ethereum stack. Oh, but actually, we're going over there. So, like, we've got the answer, and we can just do a new chain deployment and off we go." So, yeah, that's not been received terribly well. Also, brain drain. You know, they are snuffling up a good number of fairly high-profile people. DanFungible, one of the main Ethereum researchers, key guy behind the proof-of-stake transition—years of work—you know him as a primary guy, and he's off to get his paycheck. Fair play to him. A number of other people as well. But that's been the current fire. As said, this is like if Greta went to work for BP.

**[03:14] SPEAKER_02:** Well, and to be clear also, I think we've been talking about Tempo, but they're not the only corporate chain. Like, you know, obviously, Robinhood is launching an L2.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_00:** Or Arbitrum. I think it's an L1. Yeah.

**[03:24] SPEAKER_01:** So Arbitrum stack. But, yeah, I didn't know if it's an L2 or an L1. They've sort of talked about various bits on that. Circle. Circle announced ARC. Yep. You know, they're not content to be a stablecoin on other chains. It's like, right, we'll do our own chain as well. I mean, Base, you know, the whole Base thing from Coinbase. Again, you know, they haven't had a token, but, you know, there's your straight path into Coinbase.

**[03:48] SPEAKER_00:** Tether has a chain or soon, right? I think they announced something.

**[03:51] SPEAKER_01:** Maybe. I mean, they started out, you know, before Ethereum stuff was going, right? It's on Omni—that was previously MasterCoin—super ancient tech, 2013 era. But then, you know, they later moved to Ethereum and many other chains. But, yeah, like, having their own totally makes sense. And, I mean, you've had Binance Chain, you know, BNB, for years. Pretty much every major exchange seems to have their own chain now.

**[04:14] SPEAKER_00:** Uniswap has a chain? Yeah. Yeah. Uniswap has a chain. But I don't think of those as corpo chains. Like, it's hard to tell, right? It is close to the line between "Is it for us, by us?" or is it sort of like, you know, it somehow—I see the Stripe chain as, like, the incursion of the establishment into our crypto turf, whereas, like—and I kinda see Base that way a little bit—where I feel somehow less bad about Binance Chain even though Coinbase is in some ways a better actor than Binance. But very much Coinbase just feels like part of the old thing to me, you know, whereas...

**[04:47] SPEAKER_01:** But, I mean, these lines are quite arbitrary. Yeah. You know, there were various discussions I saw as well this week about Ethereum alignment. You know, what does that even mean? It's like, so these guys, they're Ethereum-aligned, so it's okay? So it's okay?

**[05:00] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, it's a strange thing that's going on. Let's take it to Bitcoin for a second. I've been critical—at least privately, maybe publicly—of the maxi mentality in which, like, you know, there will only be Bitcoin. There's only one sincere crypto asset. Everything after is a scam. Got it. And we should all put our energy into Bitcoin, but also never really add anything to Bitcoin. Maybe very slowly add small things around the margin.

**[05:23] SPEAKER_02:** Well, it's gotta stay secure. You know? See, like, we believe in open markets, but we should be the only market. Right? There should only ultimately be a single market. It's a very hypocritical...

**[05:34] SPEAKER_01:** Hypocritical as well for libertarian types. It's like, "No, no. This is all about freedom from the man," right? "You can't tell me what to do. Permissionless chains!" Yeah.

**[05:42] SPEAKER_00:** "Not like that. Everything here, just in this one approved location." Yeah. So I think it's a little bit a repeat of that phenomenon. I mean, I get it also. I guess, like, I'm a kind of a believer in the more permissive open source software licensing. Like, at the same time, maybe Linux was right as far as, like, GPL sort of forcing the commercial efforts to accrue back one place. And, you know, the BSDs survive basically with OS X to some extent. You know? And perhaps maybe it outcompeted because it had a benevolent dictator genius, but maybe it outcompeted in part because of the virality of the license. And this is not to say—I think there's a mix of licensing regimes. I know you've worked on this very directly, Bob, for the Ethereum software. Yeah. Some of it permissive, some not. But, you know, it's sort of—part of it's also, like, a lot of the Ethereum people did well enough to either launch the next thing on Ethereum or launch the next thing not on Ethereum and didn't really have any need for a job per se at some point. And so you would expect something new to come and maybe try to cannibalize the old thing. It's a strange sort of religiosity also, and I think we experienced it even back in 2015. Like, any deviation from Ethereum principles was...

**[06:53] SPEAKER_02:** Looked askance. You know? Well, maybe that's sort of a good transition. Maybe we can—you know, we, as BlockApps and Straum, went in—you know, with the Haskell implementation of Ethereum—went in our corpo chain direction. Maybe you can talk about—yeah, why would you do that? What...
