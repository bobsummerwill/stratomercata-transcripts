SPEAKER_04: The stream is live. The stream is live. Um, don't cross the streams. Who are you gonna call? You see what happens to the audio when you cross the streams. Yes, exactly. Okay. We seem to be also live on X. So welcome everyone to another Group Chat by the... Mutual Support Group Chat. Mutual Support Group, yeah. Yes, exactly. With the builders from Strato Mercada. I'm Victor Wong. I am founder and Chief Product Officer at Strato Mercada. Bob, who are you?

SPEAKER_01: Hello, I'm Head of Ecosystem.

SPEAKER_03: Kieran James Lubin, CEO. Once a coder, long time off. Code a little again. The vibe coding era has been great for making an occasional fix here and there.

SPEAKER_04: But soon we'll be back just doing commercial stuff. Yeah. I was playing around with the OpenAI browser today, and it was kind of miraculous just telling it to do stuff and seeing the cursor move around all by itself. Both miraculous and disturbing. It moves really slow. It does. It takes time to do stuff. But you just kind of keep it running in the background. Anyways, today's topic, getting us back to the topic at hand, is basically: are corporate chains back? And we obviously have some intimate knowledge about this, having been part of the rise and perhaps fall and maybe the rise again of corporate chains. Hey Lewis, nice to have you. But maybe you can—maybe Bob, you can give us an outline of the new corporate chains as they're called, like what's kind of happening currently, and then we can kind of look back over the history of corporate chains.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, the red-hot action at the moment is really about Tempo. So Tempo was announced on September the 4th by Stripe and a consortium that they got together, which—just reading initial members as well as Stripe themselves—included Anthropic, Coupang—I don't know who those are, I'm not going to say all these—Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Mercury Bank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, and Visa. So yeah, I mean, you got Shopify and Visa, you know you're doing pretty well on that payment side. And yeah, I mean, I guess especially where a lot of this tension has come in on the Ethereum side is, you know, this is going to be another EVM chain. So it's kind of like, thanks for the work, guys. We'll do a corporate version now. And, you know, so specifically Paradigm are a big part of this. Now, Paradigm have spent the last few years kind of building up Ethereum stack stuff, you know, kind of being semi-well-behaved participants within the Ethereum ecosystem—caveat a few, you know, VC nasty moments—but essentially building a, you know, hey, we've built a really good new Rust client, right? We do some of the best tooling, you know, with Foundry, right? You know, what you had going on in earlier years, right? We've made a better one. And I think there's about three or four areas where they built sort of Ethereum stack stuff, almost like, hey, here's a full-stack Ethereum stack. Oh, but actually we're going over there to like, we've got the answer and we can just like do a new chain deployment and off we go. So yeah, that's not been received terribly well. Also, big brain drain. You know, they are snuffling up a good number of fairly high-profile people. Dankrad Feist, one of the main Ethereum researchers, key guy behind the proof-of-stake transition—years of work—you know him as a primary guy, and he's off, you know, to get his paycheck. Fair play to him. You know, a number of other people as well. But that's been the current fire. As Gwati Gwat said, this is like if Greta went to work for BP.

SPEAKER_04: Well, and to be clear also, I think we've been talking about Tempo, but they're not the only corporate chain. Like, you know, obviously Robinhood is launching an L2 on Arbitrum. I think it's an L1.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so Arbitrum SPAC. But yeah, I don't know if it's an L2 or an L1. They've sort of talked about various bits on that. Circle. Circle announced ARK. Yeah. They're not content to be a smart—sorry, a stablecoin on other chains. It's like, right, we're going to do our own chain as well. I mean, Base—you know, the whole Base thing from Coinbase—again, you know, they haven't had a token, but, you know, there's your straight path into Coinbase has a chain or soon, right? I think they announced something. Maybe. I mean, they started out before Ethereum stuff was going, right? So there's an Omni that was previously Mastercoin, super ancient tech, 2013 era. But then they later moved to Ethereum and many other chains. But yeah, like having their own totally is something that makes sense. And I mean, you've had Binance Chain, you know, BNB for years. Pretty much every major exchange seems to have their own chain now. Uniswap has its chain.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Uniswap has a chain. But I don't think of those as corpo chains. It's hard to tell, right? Is it for us, by us? Somehow I see the Stripe chain as the incursion of the establishment into our crypto turf. And I kind of see Base that way a little bit, where I feel somehow less bad about Binance Chain, even though Coinbase in some ways is like a better actor than Binance. But very much, Coinbase just feels like part of the old thing to me. Whereas—I mean, these lines are quite arbitrary.

SPEAKER_01: You know, there were various discussions I saw as well this week, you know, about Ethereum alignment. You know, what does that even mean? It's like, so these guys, they're Ethereum-aligned, so it's okay. So it's okay. I think what it means—I mean, it's a strange thing that's going on in which—let's take it to Bitcoin for a second.

SPEAKER_03: I've been critical, at least privately, maybe publicly, of the maxi mentality in which there will only be Bitcoin. There's only one sincere crypto asset. Everything after is a scam. And we should all put our energy into Bitcoin, but also never really add anything to Bitcoin. Maybe very slowly add small things around the margin.

SPEAKER_04: It's got to stay secure. We believe in open markets, but this should be the only market. There should only ultimately be a single market. It's very hypocritical as well for libertarian types.

SPEAKER_03: It's like, no, no, this is all about freedom from the man, right? You know? Yeah, you can't tell me what to do. Permissionless chains. Yeah, but not like that. Everything here, just in this one approved location. So I think it's a little bit a repeat of that phenomenon. I mean, I get it. Also, I guess like, I'm kind of a believer in the more permissive open-source software licensing. At the same time, maybe Linux was right as far as GPL sort of forcing the commercial efforts to accrue back one place. And, you know, the BSDs survive basically with OS X to some extent. And perhaps maybe it outcompeted because it had a benevolent dictator genius, but maybe it outcompeted in part because of the virality of the license. And this is not to say—I think there's a mix of licensing regimes. I know you've worked on this very directly, Bob, for the Ethereum software—some of it permissive, some not. But, you know, part of it's also like a lot of the Ethereum people did well enough to either launch the next thing on Ethereum or launch the next thing not on Ethereum and didn't really have any need for a job per se at some point. And so you would expect something new to come and maybe try to cannibalize the old thing. It's a strange sort of religiosity also. And I think we experienced it even back in 2015. Even like any deviation from Ethereum principles was looked askance, you know. Well, maybe that's sort of a good transition. Maybe we can...
