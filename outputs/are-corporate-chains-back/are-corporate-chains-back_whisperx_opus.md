**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** The stream is live.

**[00:01] SPEAKER_04:** The stream is live.

**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** Don't cross the streams. Who are you going to call? We'll see what happens to the audio when you cross the streams.

**[00:08] SPEAKER_04:** Yes, exactly. Okay. We seem to be also live on X. So welcome everyone to another group chat by the... Mutual support group chat.

**[00:18] SPEAKER_00:** Mutual support group, yeah.

**[00:20] SPEAKER_04:** Yes, exactly. With the builders from Strato Mercata. I'm Victor Wong. I am founder and chief product officer at Strato Mercata. Bob, who are you?

**[00:30] SPEAKER_01:** Hello, I'm head of ecosystem.

**[00:32] SPEAKER_04:** And Kieran, who are you?

**[00:34] SPEAKER_03:** Kieran James-Lubin, CEO, once a coder, long time off. Code a little again. Vibe coding era has been great for making an occasional fix here and there. But soon we'll be back just doing commercial stuff.

**[00:48] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. I was playing around with the OpenAI browser today, and it was kind of miraculous just telling it to do stuff and seeing the cursor move around all by itself. Both miraculous and disturbing.

**[01:00] SPEAKER_03:** It moves really slow. It does.

**[01:02] SPEAKER_04:** It takes time to do stuff. But you just can't keep it running in the background. Anyways, today's topic, getting us back to the topic at hand, is basically corporate chains are back. And we obviously have some intimate knowledge about this, having been part of the rise and perhaps fall and maybe the rise again of corporate chains. Hey Lewis, nice to have you. But maybe you can, maybe Bob, you can give us an outline of the new corporate chains as they're called, like what's kind of happening currently and then we can kind of look back over the history of corporate chains.

**[01:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Well, I mean, the red hot action at the moment is really about Tempo. So Tempo was announced on September the 4th by Stripe and a consortium that they got together, which just reading, initial members as well as Stripe themselves, including Anthropic, Coupang. I don't know who those are. I'm not going to say all these. Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Mercury Bank, OpenAI. Revolut, Shopify and Visa. So, yeah, I mean, you got Shopify and Visa. You're doing pretty well on that payment side. Yeah. And yeah, I mean, I guess especially where a lot of this tension has come in. On the Ethereum side, this is going to be another EVM chain. So it's kind of like, thanks for the work, guys. We'll do a corporate version now. And so specifically, Paradigm are a big part of this. Now, Paradigm have spent the last few years kind of building up Ethereum stack stuff, being semi well-behaved participants within the Ethereum ecosystem, carry out a few VC nasty moments, but essentially building a, hey, we've built a really good new Rust client, right? We do some of the best tooling with Foundry, right? What you had going on. In earlier years, right, we've made a better one. And I think there's about three or four areas where they built sort of Ethereum stack stuff, almost like, hey, here's a full stack Ethereum stack. Oh, but actually, we're going over that. So like, we've got the answer. And we can just like do a new chain deployment. And off we go. So, yeah, that's not been received terribly well. Also, big brain drain, that they are snaffling up a good number of fairly high profile people. Dankrad Feist, one of the main Ethereum researchers, key guy behind the proof of stake transition, years at work, him as a primary guy and he's off to get his paycheck, fair play to him, a number of other people as well but that's been the current fire, as Gwati said this is like if Greta went to work for BP.

**[03:42] SPEAKER_04:** Well, and to be clear also, I think we've been talking about Tempo, but they're not the only corporate chain. Like, obviously Robinhood is launching an L2 on Arbitrum.

**[03:52] SPEAKER_01:** I think it's an L1. Yeah, so Arbitrum's stack. But yeah, I don't know if it's an L2 or an L1. They've sort of talked about various bits on that. Circle announced ARC. They're not content to be just a stablecoin on other chains, it's like right we're gonna do our own chain as well. I mean Base, the whole Base thing from Coinbase, again, they haven't had a token, but there's your straight path into Coinbase. Tether has a chain or soon, right?

**[04:18] SPEAKER_03:** I think they announced something.

**[04:20] SPEAKER_01:** Maybe. I mean, they started out before Ethereum stuff was going right. So there's an Omni that was previously Mastercoin, super ancient tech, 2013 era. But then they later moved to Ethereum and many other chains. But yeah, having their own totally is something that makes sense. And I mean, you've had Binance chain, BNB for years. Pretty much every major exchange seems to have their own chain now. Uniswap has its chain.

**[04:48] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, Uniswap has a chain. But I don't think of those as corporate chains.

**[04:52] SPEAKER_03:** It's hard to tell, right? Is it for us, by us? Or is it sort of like, somehow I see the Stripe chain as like the incursion of the establishment into our crypto turf, where it's like... and I kind of see Base that way a little bit where I feel somehow less bad about Binance chain even though Coinbase in some ways like a better actor than Binance but very much Coinbase just feels like part of the old thing to me, whereas these lines are quite arbitrary.

**[05:22] SPEAKER_01:** There were various discussions I saw as well this week about Ethereum alignment. What does that even mean? It's like, so these guys, they're Ethereum aligned, so it's okay. So it's okay.

**[05:34] SPEAKER_03:** I think what it means, I mean, it's a strange thing that's going on in which, let's take it to Bitcoin for a second. I've been critical, at least privately, maybe publicly, of the Maxi mentality in which there will only be Bitcoin. There's only one sincere crypto asset. Everything after is a scam. And we should all put our energy into Bitcoin, but also never really add anything to Bitcoin. Maybe very slowly add small things around the margin.

**[06:02] SPEAKER_04:** We believe in open markets, but we should be the only market. There should only ultimately be a single market.

**[06:08] SPEAKER_01:** It's very hypocritical as well for libertarian types.

**[06:12] SPEAKER_03:** It's like no, no, this is all about freedom from the man, right? Yeah, you can't tell me what to do. Permissionless chains. Yeah, but not like that. Everything here just in this one approved location. Yeah, so I think it's a little bit a repeat of that phenomenon. I mean, I get it also. I guess like, I'm kind of a believer in the more permissive open source software licensing. At the same time, maybe Linux was right as far as GPL sort of forcing the commercial efforts to accrue back one place and the BSDs survive basically with OS X to some extent, and perhaps maybe it out-competed because it had a benevolent dictator genius, but maybe it out-competed in part because of the virality of the license. And this is not to say, I think there's a mix of licensing regimes. I know you've worked on this very directly, Bob, for the Ethereum software, some of it permissive, some not. But part of it's also like a lot of the Ethereum people did well enough to either launch the next thing on Ethereum or launch the next thing not on Ethereum and didn't really have any need for a job per se at some point. And so you would expect something new to come and maybe try to cannibalize the old thing. It's a strange sort of religiosity also. And I think we experienced it even in like back in 2015, even like any deviation from Ethereum principles was looked askance.

**[07:42] SPEAKER_04:** Well, maybe that's sort of a good transition. Maybe we can, we as BlockApps and Strato went in, with the Haskell implementation of Ethereum, went in a corporate chain direction. Maybe, like, you can talk about why we did that. Indeed. So we may be partly to blame for this.

**[08:00] SPEAKER_03:** Partly to blame. It was barely on purpose. So rolling back in 2018, let's say late 2014, our CTO Jim and I, mostly Jim, started working on the Haskell implementation of Ethereum. And he pretty quickly got it to the point where it could like sync the testnet, and there were some chat groups, a Slack. There was a bit of the yellow paper, I guess, was out at that time.

**[08:28] SPEAKER_01:** I found an exact date for this, actually. So Jim's first commit was mid-September 2014. The yellow paper had been out about April. Really? Yeah. Gotcha.

**[08:40] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, and he might have been working on it for a while before he pushed anything. I think I would have gotten back. So we met up, we got introduced by a previous co-founder of Jim's, who I had reached out to when I started working on Ethereum. And we probably spoke the first time, June, July, something like that. And we met up in Berkeley, probably the first time, maybe August or September or thereabouts. By the way, since then, Jim continues to have a habit of building a full client to try to understand a piece of blockchain software. At some point, we were looking into the state of zero knowledge proofs, and he built a, I believe, full syncing Zcash client. It's definitely missing some features, but we still have that somewhere. As you do. As one does. So yeah, we should revisit this at some later date. So yes, we met up, he started coding and it got to the point of functional and syncing with the fairly primitive early testnets pretty quickly. And we didn't quite intend to turn it into a business right at the beginning, but the three of us, that's Victor, Jim and I, met up on January 2015, had a bunch of conferences that I've done, I've spoken about at other times, we can link people to the early days of Ethereum one perhaps that helped kind of galvanize the effort. But I think what we had was always like a pragmatic attitude, right? And so shortly after that, one of the first things we built, we found like the API interaction style to be a little odd, like the JSON RPC, the Web3 library. We're kind of like all other APIs are like this, where this is a REST API. We were kind of looking at chain.com. I think Chain actually sponsored the conference that we did or spoke or something. And it was a good like talk where it was like, well, we've got these 20 great use cases that people are doing out there in the world. Oh, and they're all on Chain. Chain also fairly soon after that seemed to go a corpo chain direction.

**[10:38] SPEAKER_01:** Was that sort of like a UTXO Bitcoin-y like?

**[10:42] SPEAKER_03:** I assume so, yeah. I think they probably either forked one of the Bitcoin clients or maybe they started from scratch. But first, definitely, they were trying to be the Bitcoin developer API. It just didn't feel like there was enough demand at that time. And I assume, like us, it was a strange period where you actually got pretty active corporate inbound. Like sometime in 2015 and then later into 2016, it was very common for corporate innovation labs to be running some kind of blockchain tech usually in an Ethereum variant and they were very explicit and maybe it's sort of like the early cloud days, like we want that thing you've got but can you just get it on prem, like can you just, yeah, can you just, like we want the ledger, we want to know who the parties are. You can't just let anyone in here. We're regulated. We want it, though. We really want it. We like this API you've got. Give it to us. We've got transactions to settle right now with our suppliers. And it all went way slower than that. But it was like the market was actually, like, screaming at you for a minute there in a way that the world feels much different now. Like, I think it is certainly true that in the 70s or 80s or whatever, it was common for the Department of Defense or some giant bank or something to be your first customer. And much later, it's sort of more the opposite, that you'd get bottoms up devs, small companies first, and then later, really big guys. And it was sort of a strange mix. I think there's like a barbell effect where really big companies have a lot of excess cash to investigate new technologies and then you get startups, and that was the feeling. And we would get the inbound from those really big companies and I think that even that era, I bet they're all doing AI now and maybe that adoption is going to, it's probably mixed, but there was a moment there where it was like screaming urgent demand.

**[12:38] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, and I would say part of that also is like when we launched blockchain as a service with Microsoft and we made it easy to effectively build your own testnets on clouds, everyone started doing it, right?

**[12:50] SPEAKER_03:** Yes.

**[12:51] SPEAKER_04:** And the interesting thing is at that time, the real development seemed to be happening by these corporates in these innovation labs versus independent labs.

**[13:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, that's right. It felt like okay, they would come to you with like a PowerPoint describing the like billion plus dollar problem that they had after all the NDAs were signed and all that sort of thing, this was like very convincing. It was like some of the use cases were bad but a lot of them were like, oh okay, like you have some like really complicated multi-organization settlement problem that you handle with spreadsheets or some ancient system and it costs a ton of money and if you actually could upgrade it, it would be way better potentially. And the vast majority of those did not work out, but it wasn't like they identified the wrong problem. It was like the will to implement across a corporation or multiple corporations, the big consortium era, was probably the issue. And to some extent, I know we want to talk a little bit about Libra, regulatory barriers as well in certain cases. But yeah, it was like so. So again, we at first started to be wanted to be just like the public net API, like Alchemy or Infura now. And I think we were just a little early for that. And then also we were going to the effort of maintaining a whole client, which was challenging because things kept changing as they continue to do. But got very much pulled in this like, let's run our own network direction by the corporates.

**[14:22] SPEAKER_04:** And I think part of it was at that early time, they couldn't hold ETH. So they were like, we want to do all these things, but we can't hold ETH. Can you make a version where we don't need to do that?

**[14:34] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, I totally forgot it was like treasury doesn't know what to do. This is pretty much like, but like no, we've got our procedures, we can't, it has to get in the ERP, we can't have like a line item for that, and it's like, I mean...

**[14:50] SPEAKER_01:** I remember with RSDB, who became Monax and so on. So they started in 2014 as well when it was still on POC 5 before the mainnet. And there you had a situation of a company being set up by lawyers who really loved the smart contract functionality. But nothing to do with that. It's like ETH is probably illegal security. Like, we don't want to get anywhere near that. It's like, so it really was the blockchain, not Bitcoin being the phrase at the time, right? The blockchain, not Ethereum, not ETH.

**[15:22] SPEAKER_04:** But the one thing that was really interesting, like when we launched that blockchain as a service and it got on Azure, like we had thousands of people spinning up stuff. And then a good number of them reaching out to us. And I will say the use cases that didn't seem speculative did come from these corporates, right? Like to Kieran's point, it's like, like we did get contacted by sort of smaller groups, but they were like, oh, well, we just want to launch our own token and sell it like that. Those are all those use cases.

**[15:50] SPEAKER_03:** That came a little later, actually. Once a couple of ICOs had happened, suddenly everyone wanted to pay someone to build their thing for an ICO. But that was kind of more like 2016 to 2018 phenomena, I would say. Yeah, that's true. The corporates came first, actually.

**[16:06] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, exactly. And so, I mean, that was our experience. And shortly afterwards, and Bob, you might have the timing, Libra by Facebook came along. And they were doing their own thing. Do you know the time? I think it was 18, 17. Yeah, we launched blockchain as a service in 2015, right?

**[16:24] SPEAKER_03:** End of 2015.

**[16:26] SPEAKER_04:** I'm feeling like it was 2016 that Libra launched.

**[16:28] SPEAKER_03:** No, it was later, I think.

**[16:30] SPEAKER_04:** Was it? Okay.

**[16:32] SPEAKER_01:** Here we go.

**[16:34] SPEAKER_04:** As our resident historian of all things blockchain.

**[16:38] SPEAKER_01:** There we go. June the 18th, 2019. Oh, yeah. Isn't that right? I was one of them. Yeah. At that point, Meta, then Facebook. This was before they'd even turned into Meta. Announced it, which was a stablecoin project intended for global payments via its applications. Sorry, via its apps. So what you have there, I mean, the other thing worth saying about Libra is Libra is not an EVM project. They had their, I guess, happening like five years later. So it's like, let's apply all of our learnings of what's worked and what has not worked over that five-year period, especially about smart contract security and having a constrained model.

**[17:18] SPEAKER_03:** Their language seems pretty good to me, actually, but no one uses it. We're stuck with Solidity will be the JavaScript slash COBOL of the crypto age, we're never getting rid of this thing.

**[17:30] SPEAKER_04:** Well, and I think the EVM has become the standard, right? Like, that's just, I mean, RedWong was mentioning that last week, and I think that that is true, basically, to a certain degree.

**[17:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think it's the JavaScript. It's the C. It's good enough that stuff got made on it, and it's never going away. This stuff is going to be there forever.

**[17:52] SPEAKER_04:** But Libra had... Sorry. Yeah. But the launch of Libra, they had super high profile partners, if I recall.

**[18:00] SPEAKER_03:** Very similar, actually, to the kind of, it was mostly like payment networks and notably no banks. It felt like a tech company-driven disintermediation play. Like, well, if we just had these stables, then we wouldn't have to have the bank account at the edge, too, and we could just... And I think this is kind of what killed it, right? Like, the banks each called up their representative and just screamed about big tech monopoly power.

**[18:28] SPEAKER_01:** So here's a list. So Facebook, Uber, Spotify, Andreessen Horowitz, Anchorage Bank, the digital custody, Lyft, Zappo, Coinbase, Union Square Ventures. So yeah, it's actually a crappier list by far than Tempo.

**[18:46] SPEAKER_03:** MasterCard was in until like the last second. Right. People started making regulator noise and they dropped, I think maybe Visa too.

**[18:54] SPEAKER_04:** So I guess that gets into the question, like, why didn't that work? Right. Like, and I think we touched, like, I recall Mark Zuckerberg having to like talk to people. Congress?

**[19:04] SPEAKER_01:** I just found these exits. So the major exits out of that were PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, Stripe, eBay. And they all dropped out real super fast, didn't they? And I mean, I think there was a mixture of things. This is my thoughts. Maybe you guys have got different thoughts. Firstly, everyone hated Facebook because they just had the Cambridge Analytica stuff. It's like, we're not going to trust you guys. Like, no. But then the second one was like regulatory stuff because it was going to be like, because it was kind of going up against the dollar. Right. It was like, right, we're going to have a basket of things. So it wasn't just a straight stablecoin. It's like, oh, we're kind of having a go at the US dollar.

**[19:46] SPEAKER_03:** And they cut the banks out of it, too. That's the point. And it's also like, the banks are fond of making their, I guess they're called market utilities. They're bank-owned industry cabals like SWIFT, the DTCC. A lot of the exchanges are like this. I guess even the, I don't really understand how that worked. Even the Fed is bank-owned, but basically like, the banks pooled a bunch of capital a long time ago, and they set up this thing that you kind of have to use. And the profits from using that thing go back to them. And it's also like a choke point. And under other circumstances, you would have some sort of antitrust issue in doing this. It's kind of like definitionally collusion. But you also need these things to make the whole thing function. But it seemed like when tech attempted to do that itself, the banks still had the ear of the relevant parties.

**[20:38] SPEAKER_01:** But I mean, that's happening here again, right? It's almost the same people. And it's basically saying, right, the banks and the credit card companies to a lesser degree, like own these pipes. And we had to like sit on top kind of thing and service. Yeah. How about like if us fintech techie companies, the Silicon Valley ones instead, how about like cut all of them out.

**[21:00] SPEAKER_03:** I think it would be cool if it happened. By the way, I always thought, though I'm a bit of a big tech hater, I always thought Libra was at least cool. Like, it would be interesting.

**[21:10] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I mean, the technology behind it, it was UTXO-based, but it seemed pretty good. Like, they did a good job from the technology side.

**[21:18] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think so. And not just doing like sort of a lazy job, I guess, because talking about some of those earlier phases, it's like, right, oh, we're going to take Bitcoin and it's an enterprise Bitcoin. OK, and then it's like, right, sort of same deal on the EVMs. But because they were that many years later, it was sort of almost like a clean room kind of effort. I think actually R3 did this with Corda, right? They did some really good blogs, right, from Richard Gendal Brown, sort of saying, hey, we looked at all of the things that these existing techs are doing, and whatever, there's these four or five different elements, and for our scenario, we need three of them, but we could do something else completely different. Coming up with a different kind of solution. I think that kind of happened with Libra as well.

**[22:02] SPEAKER_04:** It's like, let's get some brainiacs. Fabric too, right? Like, I mean, they were trying to do something.

**[22:08] SPEAKER_03:** Fabric is a funny case too. I think in all of these cases, they correctly identified problems with Ethereum and related tech. And essentially none of them did they solve those problems. They came at it with different approaches. I really tried to, I always liked Corda too, it was clean. I actually find the UTXO stuff, especially enhanced UTXO, to be aesthetically pleasing. I think even Avalanche has one of those and no one uses it. And when you really pressed, like the Corda people were like, we're compliant. We've got privacy. And what you had was like a central ordering thing and no privacy whatsoever if you wanted to double spend protection. And it was like... It was still cool and clean, and I like their state facts and this and that, but largely smoke and mirrors. Fabric was not good. It was like a hack together. Like if you think about what a system integrator would build. It's like, well, we've got a Kafka thing. We've got this other thing. We've got a little bit of inter-process communication. We've got an API. That's what it was. I don't think there was a real clean vision for Fabric.

**[23:12] SPEAKER_01:** You mean like something IBM might build?

**[23:14] SPEAKER_03:** Yes, I'm saying.

**[23:16] SPEAKER_02:** It's like, well, if you just kind of put this thing with that thing and there's a consensus, it's kind of like a blockchain. You'll never get sacked for buying it either.

**[23:24] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, you won't get sacked. It's open source.

**[23:28] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, and I think one of the common things was like all of those things had no token incentives, right? So like you kind of had to go down that route to a certain degree because how else do you make sure, how else do you get something blockchain-like? Like I do think if you don't have token incentives really, it all kinds of falls apart to a certain degree.

**[23:48] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I mean, the model that you had for all of these is, well, these are running within a consortium which already has legal agreements. So we don't need to be permissionless because we know who's done the bad shit and we've got a contract and we'll sue you or whatever. And if you have got that situation, well, there's a whole lot of simplification that you can do. If you look at proof of work in particular, and what that overhead that you have on Bitcoin or Ethereum at that time, it's incredibly expensive way of doing things versus the simpler approaches. And like the stats I saw from a thing Colin Platt did in around 2018 was like, he worked out it was maybe as much as a hundred million times more expensive to do stuff on the EVM versus a single AWS node that you're running yourself where you've obviously got complete trust. But that's like the overhead, right? That's what you're paying. It's quite a bit of overhead. So why do you guys, and that's part of the answer, and I'm just kind of curious from you guys, I have my own view, is like why do you think the first era of corporate chains didn't work?

**[24:52] SPEAKER_03:** I think the biggest factor is that the organizations were not ready to behave in a blockchain-y way. And at the time that manifested in feature requests, like it's missing X. Can my competitors see my customers? What are the balances? Will they be able to see total trading volumes, sales volumes? And that's still a problem on the public nets, et cetera. But it's sort of just like you kind of have to let it be, embrace it. They would have had to turn it on persistently at small volume, and then like, kind of like, let it grow and fix the problems as they went. And what they instead wanted was like a totally complete product that fits perfectly in their current workflow and existing, like, one thing people really are using, seem to sincerely be using stables for like, global internal clearing and settlement. And we actually, I won't say the names, but we competed for, didn't win a project for like a big, call them a utility that's global to do that. And the use case was actually really good. And they had such tremendous volumes that like dealing with the currency fluctuations was like a giant line item that they had to deal with. They wanted a permissioned chain for it. You could just do it with stables today. That's why there'll always be a little bit of demand for non-USD stables. But you may as well just use the public chains to move money around the world now. And then you could build from that into various other use cases. I believe Stripe even does this. I think I've seen them say that.

**[26:28] SPEAKER_04:** And PayPal does it. PayPal does it.

**[26:30] SPEAKER_03:** And that's what they would have needed to do. And instead it was like, they had to like go very top down. There's budgeting, setting up legal entities, maybe investing in a consortium, very tight rules about how the data could flow, which data, all that sort of thing. And it sort of, it led to like a strangulation where you would kind of just need to like let it bloom a little bit and that's what the public chains did. They also had the incentive mechanism. It's not like there's a ton of corporate usage of public chains now, although I guess there's like institutional style financial usage that's now not quite large, but even for like, I think you'll see some just corporate operational stuff which again the like stablecoin, global clearing remittance, settlement remittance stuff is starting to get there. I think that will happen the way I described, as opposed to, again, these folks all have done extremely heavy IT implementations. I've heard that, at least in the era when Oracle and SAP were big at it, on average, an ERP implementation takes 5% of global revenue, no matter the size of the project.

**[27:38] SPEAKER_04:** So like the bigger you are just like, like I think Victor you maybe you mentioned to me once working on one for like a full decade. And when I started, when I started at a company they were, they had already been working on an SAP implementation and when I left six years later they were still working on it. So it was just like, yeah, the project like the like...

**[27:58] SPEAKER_03:** It's hard to do things incrementally in corporate, but in part it's because it's super complicated and very regulated and whatever, but it's also mentality too. Just kind of like turn it on and then just start it. I mentioned this is what happened with the cloud. They're like, all right, let me just do this one little thing. And it's easy and you keep just putting more and more on there. And now you have like, I think like JP Morgan turned almost all of its on-prem stuff off and it's all on Amazon or all on... So I think that was the problem. And the consortium model really means you gotta like pre-think and have like multi-party agreements with everybody and like then it's, the negotiation was endless. It's hard to do the data modeling. I think that was the problem at its core. But I think it came down, if the corporations like had this like let's just play with it mentality, you might have gotten where I'm describing.

**[28:52] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. And Bob, what do you think? Do you have anything to add on?

**[28:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of it is just technical maturity as well. There wasn't really any ZK back then. So it's like, how do you do privacy? How does that work? And I mean, that's how Quorum like came into existence was that Amber and the team at JP Morgan wanted to do something. And without like a privacy story, it was never going to get approved. Like they wouldn't be allowed to do anything. So it was like, okay, well, what's the thing we could do? Okay, we can have a private database and like that can be offered around the side and you just do hashes on the mainnet and the other bits are permissioned. So it's kind of like, there's a workaround for it. But they did that with open eyes, knowing like the ZK stuff is coming late, but it's not there. We have to do some hacky thing. Otherwise, we're literally not going to be allowed to do anything. I mean, this was also a story.

**[29:46] SPEAKER_04:** I think that's true, too. I'll add my take.

**[29:48] SPEAKER_03:** While I agree with you, I still think everyone who found that deficiency, none of them solved it better, really, than what exists in the public chains out there today.

**[29:58] SPEAKER_01:** No.

**[30:00] SPEAKER_03:** It is kind of... I keep asking the AIs and looking around the internet on the state of ZK, still not really there, maybe a little bit. The enterprises all want the following permissioning model. I should be able to send value to Victor. He should know that whatever I have really exists. You should be able, he should be able to send it on to you. You should be able to verify that Victor had it, but not know that it came from me or how much he has total. And the regulator should somehow be able to see all of this, at least in a financial services setting. And it mostly can't do that still. I kind of, I can't really tell. Like I think Zcash is the closest. And then there are various ZK things, both on, a lot of the ZK is for efficiency like throughput as compared to privacy at this time. But mostly that use case still can't really be done. There's some hints that there's like a Cosmos, which you never hear about, project that kind of does that. I have a summary I think I've sent you before. But it's still not there. But they are using it right, like Stripe's moving money around the world. So I think I also think it's like the rigidity of the mentality actually being a bigger factor.

**[31:08] SPEAKER_01:** Totally. I mean, the other tech piece there is scaling though, right? Yes. Because at that time, it was like, yeah, you've just got the Ethereum mainnet and everything's got to go on it. So it's like useless. But we've really got a way better L2 story now.

**[31:24] SPEAKER_04:** So that's... Well, I kind of think the fundamental problem from my point of view is like they don't think of themselves like communities and they don't want to share. Right. So like, so like when I talk about tokenomics, I think tokenomics provides you a system where participants can get everything. So, not to go into names of the projects, but we built some very large consortium chains. And then at some point, every single one of those chains said, oh, well, we need data from this source that this group of people have. And then the question is like, well, why would that group, shippers or whatever, provide that data? And there are always answers like, oh, we'll just force them to do it. But it never worked.

**[32:10] SPEAKER_03:** A big reason. And I guess this is part what I meant by mentality. But yes, the incentive alignment specifically was a huge problem where like a lot of the time it's like either one of them wants the thing way more than the others and is willing to pay for it. One of them. Yeah. Or like this is like the Walmart IBM thing that didn't go anywhere.

**[32:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Maersk as well.

**[32:32] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. Or a bunch of parties have roughly equal interest in the thing, but then like no one really wants to pay for it. It's like it gets treated like a utility, like, well, let's pay cost recovery in, and like it's slow. There's not the urgency to get those sort of things done. And in both cases, you have big trouble attracting like the rest of the value chain. Right. And so we concluded you definitely just had to turn the thing on and let them come in as they're ready and it's, I think it's worked the best in public chains because there's sort of a common token if you will and people are excited about the value of that token rising. By the way, this goes back to like other than technological deficiencies, like why do people decide to stick with Ethereum or do something else. And it's like, what's going to make the most money? Ethereum's got a lot of assets on it. Maybe you can get some of them. Maybe you should just sit there. But if there's something you're just bumping your head against and you can't quite figure out how to, you might have to leave, which is, plenty of people have experienced that, including us.

**[33:34] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. And it's true for any real platform like the app stores, right? Everyone, myself included, we built for iOS first because they figured out payment, they figured out micropayments really quickly so we could get paid for what we did, right? So, okay, here's a question that we'll close out on. Are the new round of corporate chains the future or are they DOA based on similar problems? I'll start with Bob on this one.

**[34:00] SPEAKER_01:** They are not solving the same problems as truly permissionless ecosystems. However, it's not a winner takes all either. So I think maybe the losers here are going to be the banks. That they can get their business eaten a lot easier than this can cannibalize Bitcoin or Ethereum, I think.

**[34:22] SPEAKER_04:** Okay. Kieran, your verdict? Good question. DOA or the future?

**[34:28] SPEAKER_03:** I think we'll get a couple long-lived corpo chains. I agree with that. I think there'll be semi-niche. I mean, I think of SWIFT as a corpo chain.

**[34:38] SPEAKER_04:** Yes.

**[34:40] SPEAKER_03:** DTCC, corporate chain. They just happen to not be using a blockchain and both of them are sort of trying to. Right. So we're not going to completely get rid of that. I think they won't go huge like and they might actually be like enormous volume, but like I both won't be allowed to and probably will never like run a validator on one. I agree also that they're not going to siphon that much value from public chains. I think the tech may be similar back end pipes from your bank account or when Stripe launches bank accounts versus your MetaMask account, but that they're not really gonna be that much intermingling of the two. One will have bearer assets, one largely will not. And the uncensorability is really important at the end of the day. So yeah, I don't think they'll go away. I think it's very... I think the most immediate failure mode on all of these is political. Like if we see a big flip around, they'll get killed again. Where the permissionless chains will maybe suffer in price a little bit, but probably not. But I am surprised that the banks, I mean, they're already trying to rewrite the Genius Act so that Coinbase can stop, to prevent Coinbase from offering rewards. And one way or another, the banks are finished either from the fintechs or crypto or both. The big ones around and are kind of tech companies anyway, but it is only regulatory capture protecting them at this point.

**[36:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, I think it is both because payments is quite different from lots of other things happening on the blockchain side, right? Yeah. Savings, store of value, dApps. You're not going to run dApps on Tempo. Yeah. You're not going to save your money in Tempo coin.

**[36:18] SPEAKER_03:** Right. I agree. There will not be a lot of DeFi on Tempo, for instance, sort of because it would be too closed of an environment. You won't get the compositional aspect of things, probably because they won't allow it. I think in theory you could, but you won't.

**[36:32] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. So my view is that the projects that might succeed in this space have to have two properties. One is they have to be driven by at least mostly one company. I don't think this idea of the bigger names who have all together, like we've experienced this, that just slows everything down to your point.

**[36:52] SPEAKER_03:** A lot of grandstanding legal departments.

**[36:54] SPEAKER_04:** It sounds good, but operationally it's terrible. But the other thing is that they have to have that sort of community mindset from the start. Like, I think things like Base and Binance Chain have been able to do this because they brought a Web3 mentality, even though they drove it at first. And so I think the projects that are likely to kind of evolve are those kind of projects. That would be my prediction.

**[37:18] SPEAKER_01:** And I guess also because their customer base are crypto-y people. It's a similar kind of group. And they understand those demands, right?

**[37:26] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.

**[37:28] SPEAKER_01:** Tempo will be going for retail. It's going to be normal retail, Apple Pay, Tempo Pay.

**[37:34] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. You're not going to know you're using Tempo, most likely. It could, yeah, I guess the banks could really suffer or it could be the credit card networks that really suffer.

**[37:44] SPEAKER_04:** I mean, I think the first victim is SWIFT, really. Like, I think, but yeah. So, well, on that note, I'll give a quick preview to everyone. Let's wrap up today's conversation. Thank you for joining us. Quick preview for next week. We have Brian, founder of PistachioFi, joining us next week to talk about starting a new project. And his background, actually, he was previously an employee at BlockApps, so we know him very, very well. So if you want to find us, we're always doing this every week. But if you want to find me, you can find me on X at Vic4Wong. You can find out why it's, I have the four in my name. Bob has posted that on our Telegram. Thanks. Bob, where can people find you if they want to hear more from you?

**[38:32] SPEAKER_01:** So yeah, again, X. So Bob Summerwill. So Summer like the season, Will like write your will. That's me.
