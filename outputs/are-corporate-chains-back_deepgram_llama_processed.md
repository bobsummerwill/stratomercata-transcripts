**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] The stream is live.
[00:00] The stream is live.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] Don't cross the streams.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:02] Who are you gonna call? We'll see what happens to the audio when you cross the streams. Yes. Exactly. Okay. We seem to be also live on x. So welcome everyone to another group chat for by the...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:10] Mutual support group chat. Mutual support group. Yeah. Of fairness.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:12] Yes. Exactly. With the builders from Straum, I'm Victor Wong. I am founder and chief product officer at Straum Mercado.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:15] Bob, who are you? Hello. I'm head of ecosystem.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:17] And Karen, who are you? Karen James,

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:19] Once a coder, you know, long time off. Code a little again. Vibe coding era has been great, for making an occasional fix here and there.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[00:22] But soon, soon, we'll be back just doing commercial stuff. You know? I was playing around with the OpenAI browser today, and it was kind of miraculous just telling it to do stuff and seeing, like, the cursor move around. It was both miraculous and disturbing. You know? Yeah. Client good at that, though it moves really slow. It does. It takes time to do stuff. And but you just can't keep it running in the background. Anyways, today's topic, getting us back to the topic at hand, is basically our corporate chain's back. And we, obviously have some intimate knowledge about this, having been part of the rise and perhaps fall and maybe the rise again of corporate chains. Hey. Hey, Lewis. Nice to have you. But maybe you can, maybe, Bob, you can give us an outline of the new corporate chains as they're called. Like, what's what's kind of happening currently? And then we can kind of look back over the history of corporate chains.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:40] Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, the red hot action at the moment is really about tempo. You know? So tempo was announced on September 4 by Stripe and a consortium that they got together, which just reading initial members as well as Stripe themselves, including Anthropic, Coupang. I don't know who those are. I'm not gonna sell these. Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Mercury Bank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, and Visa. So, yeah, I mean, you got Shopify and Visa. You know, you're doing pretty well on the payment side.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[01:05] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:06] And, yeah, I mean, I guess, where a lot of this tension has come in on the Ethereum side is, you know, this is gonna be another EVM chain. So it's kind of like, thanks for the work, guys. We'll do a corporate version now. And, you know, so, specifically, Paradigm are a big part of this. Now, Paradigm have spent the last few years kind of building up Ethereum stack stuff, you know, kind of being semi-well-behaved participants within the Ethereum ecosystem, coming out a few, you know, VC nasty moments, but essentially building a, you know, hey, we've built a really good new Rust client. Right? We do some of the best tooling, you know, with Foundry. Right? You know, what we had going on in earlier years. Right? We've made a better one, and I think there's about three or four areas where they built sort of Ethereum stack stuff. Almost like, hey, here's a full stack Ethereum, you know, stack. Oh, but actually, we're going over that. So, like, we've got the answer, and we can just, like, do a new chain deployment and off we go. So, yeah, that's not been received terribly well. Also, brain drain, you know, that they are snuffling up a good number of fairly high-profile people. Danfungible, one of the main Ethereum researchers, key guy behind the proof of stake transition, you know, years at work. You know him as a primary guy, and he's off, you know, to get his paycheck. Fair play to him, you know, a number of other people as well. But that's been the current, you know, fire as said, this is like if Greta went to work for BP.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:30] Well, and to be clear also, I think we've been talking about Tempo, but they're not the only corporate chain. Like, you know, obviously, Robin told us launching an L2.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:35] Arbitrarily, I think it's an L1. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:37] So, Arbitrum's stack. But, yeah, they, they, yeah, I didn't know if it's an L2 or an L1. They've sort of talked about various bits on that. Circle. Circle announced Arc. Yep. You know, they're they're not content to be a smart, sorry, a stable coin on other chains. It's like, right, we're gonna do our own chain as well. I mean, Base, you know, the whole Base thing from Coinbase. Mhmm. Again. You know, they haven't had a token, but, you know, there's your straight path into, you know, into Coinbase.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:10] Tether has a chain or soon. Right? I think they announced something.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:12] Maybe. I mean, they started out, you know, before Ethereum stuff was going. Right? It's on Omni that was previously MasterCoin, you know, super ancient tech, 2013 era, but then, you know, they later moved to Ethereum and many other chains. But, yeah, like, having their own totally, you know, is something that makes sense. And, I mean, you've had, you know, finance chain, you know, BNB for, for, for years. Pretty much every major exchange seems to have their own chain now.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:40] ENS swap has a chain? Yeah. Yeah. ENS swap has a chain. But I don't think of those as corporate chains. Like, it's hard to tell. Right? It's like, it is close to line between, is it for us, by us, or is it sort of like, you know, it, it somehow, I, I see the Stripe Chain as, like, the incursion of the establishment into our crypto turf, whereas, like, and I kinda see Base that way a little bit, where I, I feel somehow less bad about Binance Chain, even though Coinbase, in some ways, like, a better actor than Binance. But, very much, Coinbase just feels like part of the old thing to me, you know, whereas...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:15] But, I mean, these lines are quite arbitrary. Yeah. You know, there were various discussions I saw as well this week, you know, about Ethereum alignment. You know, what does that even mean? It's like, so these guys, they're Ethereum Alliance, so it's okay. So it's okay. I think what it means...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:30] I mean, it's a strange thing that's going on, in which, let's take it to Bitcoin for a second. Mhmm. I've been critical, at least privately, maybe, maybe publicly, of the maxi mentality, in which, like, you know, there will only be Bitcoin. There's only one sincere crypto asset. You know? Everything after is a scam. Got it. And we should all put our energy into Bitcoin, but also never really add anything to Bitcoin. Maybe very slowly add small things around the margin.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[05:00] Well, it's gotta stay secure. You know? See, like, we believe in open markets, but we should be the only market. Right? There should only ultimately be a single market. You know, I, it's a, it's a very hypocritical...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:10] Hypocritical, as well, for libertarian types. It's like, no. No. This is all about freedom from the man. Right? You know? Yeah. You can't tell me what to do. Permission has changed. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:20] Not like that. Everything here, just in this one approved location. Yeah. So, I think it's a little bit a repeat of that phenomenon. I mean, I get it also. I guess, like, I'm a kind of a believer in the more permissive open source software licensing. Like, at the same time, maybe Linux was right, as far as, like, GPL, sort of forcing the commercial efforts to crew back one place. And, you know, the BSDs survive basically with OS 10 to some extent. You know? And perhaps, maybe, it outcompeted because it had a benevolent dictator genius, but maybe it outcompeted in part because of the virality of the license. And this is not to say I, I think there's a mix of licensing regimes. I know you've, you've worked on this very directly, Bob, for the Ethereum software. Yeah. Some of it permissive, some not.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[06:10] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:11] But, you know, I, I, it's sort of, part of it's also, like, a lot of the Ethereum people did well enough to either launch the next thing on Ethereum or launch the next thing not on Ethereum, and didn't really have any need for a job per se, at some point. And so, you would expect something new to come and maybe try to cannibalize the old thing. It's, it's, it's a strange sort of religiosity, also, and I, I think we experienced it even in, like, back in 2015, even. Like, any deviation from Ethereum principles was...

**SPEAKER_02:**
[06:40] Looked, looked as scant. You know? Well, well, maybe that's sort of a good transition. Maybe we can, you know, we, as BlockApps and Stratum, went in, you know, with the Haskell implementation of Ethereum, went in our corporate chain direction. Maybe, like, you can talk about, yeah, why would you do that? What, indeed. There. So, we may be partly to blame for this. Partly to blame. You know, it's...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:00] And it was barely on purpose. So, rolling back in '20, let's say, late twenty fourteen, our CTO Jim and I, mostly Jim, started working on the Haskell implementation of Ethereum. And he pretty quickly got it to the point where it could, like, sync the test net. You know? And there were some chat groups, a Slack. There was a bit of a, the yellow paper, I guess, was out at that time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:20] I found an exact date for this, actually. So, Jim's first commit was mid-September twenty fourteen. Yeah. That's understandable. The yellow, I just, the yellow paper had been out about April.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:30] So, really? Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. And he, he might have been working on it for a while before he pushed anything. I think, I would have gotten back. So, we met up, we got introduced by previous co-founder of Jim's, who I had reached out to when I started working on Ethereum. And we probably spoke the first time, June, July, something like that. And we met up in Berkeley, probably the first time, maybe August or September or thereabouts. By the way, since then, Jim continues to have a client of habit of building a full client to try to understand a piece of blockchain software. At some point, we were looking into the state of zero-knowledge proofs, and he built a, I believe, full syncing Zcash client. It's definitely missing some features, but we still have that somewhere in, as you do. As you do. Yeah. As one does. As one does. That's right. So, yeah, we, we actually, we should revisit this at some later date. But, so, he, so, yes, we, we met up. He started coding, and it got to the point of functional and syncing with the fairly primitive early test nets pretty quickly. And, you know, we, we didn't quite intend to turn it into a business right at the beginning. But the three of us, that's Victor, Jim, and I, met up on January 2015, had a bunch of conferences that I, I've done, I've spoken about, you know, at other times. We can link people to the early days of Ethereum one, perhaps. That helps kind of galvanize the effort. But, I, I think what we had was always like a pragmatic attitude. Right? And so, shortly after that, one of the first things we built, we found, like, the API interaction style to be a little odd, like the JSON RPC, the web three library. We're kinda like, all other APIs are like this, where, where this is a REST API. We were kinda looking at Chain.com. I think Chain actually sponsored the conference that we did, or spoke, or something, and it was a good, like, talk, where it was like, well, we've got these 20 great use cases that people are doing out there in the world. Oh, and they're all on chain. You know? Chain also, fairly soon after that, seemed to go a corporate chain direction.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:30] Well, was that sort of like a UTXO, Bitcoin-y like?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:32] Because I know, I assume so. Yeah. I think they, I think they probably either forked one of the Bitcoin clients or maybe they started from scratch. But, but first, definitely, they were trying to be the Bitcoin developer API. It just didn't feel like there was enough demand at that time. And, I, I assume, like us, it was a strange period where you actually got pretty active corporate inbound. Like, sometime in 2015, and then later into 2016, it was very common for corporate innovation labs to be running some kind of blockchain tech, usually in Ethereum variant. And, you know, they, they were very explicit. And maybe, you know, it's sort of like the early cloud days. Like, we want that thing you've got, but can you just get it on prem? Like, can you just, yeah, can you just, like, want the ledger. We'd wanna know who the parties are. You can't just let anyone in here. We're regulated. We want it, though. We, we really want it. We like this API you've got. Give it to us. We got transactions to settle right now with our suppliers. And, it all went way slower than that. But it was like it was like the market was actually, like, screaming at you for a minute there, in a way that the world feels much different now. Like, I, I think, it is certainly true that, so, like, in the, I don't know, seventies or eighties or whatever, was common for, like, the Department of Defense, or some giant bank, or something, to be your first customer. And, much later, it's sort of more of the opposite, that you'd get, like, bottoms-up, devs, small companies first, and then later, really big guys. And it was sort of a, a strange mix. It's like you get, I, I think, there's, a barbell effect, where really big companies have a lot of excess cash to investigate new technologies, and then you get start-ups. You know? And, and that was a feeling, and, and we would get the inbound from those really big companies. And, you know, I, I think that even that era, you know, I bet they're all doing AI now, and maybe, maybe that adoption is going, it's probably mixed, but, there was a moment there, where it was, like, screaming, urgent demand.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[11:30] Yeah. I know it's a part of that also, is, like, when we launched blockchain as a service, with Microsoft, and we made it easy to effectively build your own test nets on clouds, everyone started doing. Right? Yes. And the interesting thing is, at that time, the real development seemed to be happening by these corporates, in these innovation labs, versus, you know, independent dapps.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:50] Yeah. That's right. It felt like, okay, they would come to you with, like, a PowerPoint, describing the, like, billion-plus-dollar problem that they have. This is after all the NDAs were signed, and all that sort of thing. This was, like, very convincing. It was, you, you know, some of the use cases were bad, but a lot of them are like, oh, okay. Like, you have some, like, really complicated, multi-organization settlement problem, that you handle with spreadsheets, or some ancient system, and it costs a ton of money. And if you actually could upgrade it, it would be way better, potentially. And the vast majority of those did not work out. You know? But it, it wasn't like, they identified the wrong problem. It was like, the will to implement, across a corporation, or multiple corporations. They're this big consortium era, was probably the issue. And, to some extent, I, I know, we wanna talk a little bit about Libra, you know, regulatory barriers, as well, in certain cases. But, yeah, it was like, so, so, again, we, in at first, started to be, wanted to be, just like the public net API, like Alchemy, or an Infura, now. And I think we're just a little early for that. And then, also, we're going to the effort of maintaining a whole client, which was challenging, because things kept changing, as they continue to do. But, got very much pulled in this, like, let's run our own network direction.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[13:00] By the corporates. And, and I think part of it was, at that early time, they couldn't hold ETH. So, they were like, we won't do all these things, but we can't hold ETH. Can you make a version where we don't need to do it, to do all these things? Yeah. I know. Yeah. I totally forgot. Was like, treasury doesn't know what to do. This is like, it's pretty much, like, you know, but, but now we got our procedures. We can't, you know, it has to get in the ERP.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:20] We can't have, like, a line item for that. And, you know, it's like, I mean, I remember...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[13:22] I remember, with, you know, who became Monax, and so on, you know, there, so they started, in 2014, as well, when it was still on PoC-5, before the mainnet. And they had a situation of a company being set up by lawyers, who, you know, really love the smart contract functionality, but nothing to do with ETH. It's like, ETH is probably an illegal security. Like, we, we don't wanna get anywhere near that. It's like, it really was the, you know, the blockchain, not Bitcoin, being the phrase at the time. Right? Though, blockchain, not Ethereum. Not either.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[14:00] But, the one thing that was really interesting, like, when we launched that blockchain as a service, and it got on Azure, like, we had thousands of people spinning up stuff, and then a good number of them reaching out to us. And I will say, the use cases that didn't seem speculative, did come from these corporates, right, like, to Karen's point. It's like, Mhmm. Like, we did get contacted by sort of...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:20] Smaller groups, but they were like, oh, well, we just want a large, our own token, and sell it. Like, that, those use cases. And then, well, I mean, I think that came a little later, actually. I think that took a once a couple of ICOs had happened, like, suddenly everyone wanted to pay someone to build their thing for an ICO. Yep. But, that was kinda more like 2016 to 2018 phenomenon, I would say. Yeah. That's true. The corporates came first, actually, which was great. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:00] And, and so, I mean, you know, that was our experience. And, shortly afterwards, and, Bob, you might have the timing. Libra, by Facebook, came along, and they were doing their own thing. Do, do you know what the time was? Libra was '18 or '17? We launched blockchain as a service in 2015. Right? And we, end of 2015. Oh, I'm, I'm feeling like it was 2016 that Libra launched. No. It was later, I think. Was it? Okay. Here we go. As a resident historian, of all things blockchain. Here we go. 06/18/2019.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:40] Oh, I was in LA. Okay. That was really, so, yeah, at that point, Meta, then Facebook, this was before they'd even turned into Meta, you know, announced it, which is a stablecoin project, intended for global payments, via its applications, sorry, via its apps. So, what you have there, I mean, the other thing worth saying about Libra, is Libra is not an EVM project. You know, they, they had their, I guess, you know, they're, like, happening, like, five years later. Yeah. So, it's like, you know, let's apply all of our learnings, of what's worked, and what has not worked, over that five-year period, especially about smart contract security, and, you know, yeah, having a constrained model.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[16:20] Their language seems pretty good to me, actually, just, but no one uses it. We're stuck with Solidity, will be the JavaScript/COBOL of the crypto age.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[16:25] We're never getting rid of this thing, let's say. Well, and, and, you know, like, I think the EVM has become the standard. Right? Like, that's just, you know, I mean, Red One was mentioning that last week, and I think that that is true, basically, to a certain degree. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it's the, it's the JavaScript.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[16:40] It's the C. It's good enough, that stuff got made on it, and it's never going away. Yeah. It's gonna be, you know, this stuff is gonna be there forever. Or, like, ENS. But, Libra had, sorry, yeah. But, the launch of Libra, they had super high-profile partners, if I recall too. Very similar, actually, to the...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[17:00] Kind of, it was mostly, like, payment networks, and notably, no banks. It felt like a tech company-driven, Fintech, disintermediation play. Like, well, if we just had these stables, then we wouldn't have to have the bank accounts at the edge, too, and we could just, and I think this is kinda what killed it. Right? Like, the banks, like, each called up their representative, and just screamed about big tech, you know, monopoly power.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[17:30] Sorry. Here's a list. So, Facebook, Uber, Spotify, Anderson Horowitz. Why they would be in there? Anchorage, Bank, the social custody, Lyft, Zappo, Coinbase, Union Square Ventures. So, yeah, it's, it's actually a crappier list, by far, than Tempo.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[17:50] You know, Mastercard was in, until, like, the last second. Right. The people started making regulator noise, and they dropped, I think, maybe Visa too. Oh, yeah. So, so...

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:00] I guess, that, that's into the question, like, why didn't that work? Right? Like, and I think we've touched. Like, I recall Mark Zuckerberg having to, like, talk to congress, and, yeah, just...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:10] Like, I just found these, these exits. So, the major exits out of that were, were, PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe. Right. Yeah. EBay. And, I, I mean, I think, there was a mixture of things. This is my thoughts. Maybe you guys have got different thoughts. Firstly, everyone hated Facebook, because they just had the Cambridge Analytica stuff. It's like, we're not gonna trust you, you guys. Like, no. But, then, the second one was, like, regulatory stuff, because it was gonna be, like, because it was kinda going up against the dollar. Right? It was, this, it was like, right, we're gonna have a basket of things. So, it wasn't just a straight stable coin. It's like, oh, we're kinda having a go at the US dollar.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[19:00] And, they cut the banks out of it, too. That's the, the, the point. Like, and it, and it's also, like, the banks are fond of making their, I guess, they're called market utilities. You know, they, they're bank-owned industry cabals, like SWIFT, the DTCC. Some, a lot of the exchanges are like this. I guess, even the, I don't really understand how that worked. Even the Fed is bank-owned. But, basically, like, the banks pooled a bunch of capital, a long time ago, and they set up this thing, that you kind of have to use. And, the profits from using that thing, go back to them, and it's also, like, a choke point. You know? And, like, under other circumstances, you would have some sort of antitrust issue, in doing this. Like, it's, it's kind of, like, definitionally, collusion. But, the, you also need these things, right, to make the whole thing function. But, it seemed like, when tech attempted to do that itself, like, the banks still had the ear of the relevant parties, and...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[20:00] Shut it down. But, I mean, that's happening here again. Right? If you, that's precisely what's happening. Yeah. Yeah. It's almost the same people, and it's basically saying, right, you know, the banks, and the credit card companies, to a lesser degree, like, own these pipes, and we have to, like, sit on top, kind of thing, in service. Yeah. How about, like, if US Fintech, techie companies, the Silicon Valley ones, instead...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[20:30] How about, like, cut all of them out. I think it'll be cool if it happens. Right? Like, the banks, like, each called up their representative, and just screamed about big tech, you know, monopoly power.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[20:40] I mean, the, the other, the other tech is there, is scaling, though. Right? Yes. At that time, it was like, yeah, you've just got the Ethereum mainnet, and everything's gotta go on it. So, it's, like, useless. But, we've, you know, we've really got a way better L2 story now. So, that's...

**SPEAKER_02:**
[21:00] You, well, I, I kind of think, the fundamental problem, from my point of view, is, like, they don't think of themselves, like, communities, and they don't wanna share. Right? So, like, when I talk about tokenomics, I think tokenomics provides you a system, where participants can get everything. So, you know, not to go into names of the projects, but we built some very large consortium chains. And, then, at some point, every single one of those chains said, oh, well, we need data from this source, that this group of people have. And, then, the question is, like, well, why would that group, you know, shippers, or whatever, provide that data? And, they're always, they're always answers, like, oh, we'll just force them to do it, but it never worked. Like, this is a...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[22:00] Big reason, and I guess this is in part what I meant by mentality. But, yes, the incentive alignment, specifically, was a huge problem, where, like, a lot of times, like, either one of them wants the thing way more than the others, and is willing to pay for it. One of the, yeah. Yeah. Or, like, this is, the Walmart, IBM thing, that didn't go anywhere. Yeah. Musk, as well. Sure. Yep. Or, a bunch of parties have roughly equal interest in the thing, but, then, like, no one really wants to pay for it. It's like, it gets treated like a utility, well, let's pay cost recovery, in, you know, and, like, it's slow. There's not the urgency, to get those sort of things done. And, in both cases, you have big trouble, attracting, like, the rest of the value chain. Right? And, so, we concluded, you definitely just had to turn the thing on, and let them come in, as they're ready. And, you know, one way or another, and it's, I think it's worked the best, in public chains, because there's sort of a common, token, if you will, and people are excited about the value of that token rising. By the way, this goes back to, like, other than technological deficiencies. Like, why do people decide to stick with Ethereum, or do something else? And, it's like, what's going to make the most money? Like, right. Ethereum's got a lot of assets on it. Maybe you can get some of them. Maybe you should just sit there. But, yeah, you know, if there's something you're just bumping your head against, and you can't quite figure out how to, you might have to, you know, go leave, which, which is, you know, plenty of people have experienced that, including us. Yeah. And, it's true, for any real platform, like the app stores. Right? Everyone...

**SPEAKER_02:**
[24:00] You know, myself included, we built for iOS first, because they figured out payment, they figured out micropayments, really quickly, so we could get paid for what we did. Right? So, okay, here's a, here's a question, that we'll close out on. Are the new round of corporate chains, the future, or are they DOA, based on similar problems? I'll start with Bob on this one.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[24:20] They, are not solving the same problems, as truly permissionless ecosystems. However, it's not, it's not a winner-takes-all, either. So, I think, maybe the losers here, are gonna be the banks. So, they can get their business eaten, a lot easier, than this can cannibalize Bitcoin, or Ethereum, I think.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[24:40] K. Karen, your verdict? Could be okay. Or are they in the future?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[24:42] I think we'll get a couple long-lived, corpo chains. I agree with that. I think they'll be semi-niche. I mean, I think of SWIFT, as a corpo chain. Yes. DTCC, corpo chain. They just happen to not be using a blockchain, and both of them are sort of trying to. Right? So, we're not gonna completely get rid of that. I think they won't go huge. Like, and, to, I mean, they might actually be, like, enormous volume, but, like, I, both, won't allow, to be allowed to do, and probably will never, like, run a validator on one. I don't, I agree also, that they're not going to siphon that much value from public chains. Like, I, think, the tech may be similar, back-end pipes, from your bank account, or, you know, when Stripe launches bank accounts, versus your, you know, MetaMask account, but, that, they're not really gonna be that much intermingling, to the two. Like, the one will have bare assets. One, largely, will not. They're, you know? And, the uncensorability, is really important, at the end of the day. So, yeah. So, I don't think they'll go away. I think it's very, so, I think the most immediate failure mode, on all of these, is political. Like, if we see a big flip around, they'll get killed again, where the permission change. So, the, the, permissionless chains will maybe suffer, in price, a little bit, but, probably not. But, I am surprised, that the banks, I mean, they're already trying to rewrite the genius act, so that Coinbase can stop, to prevent Coinbase from offering rewards. And, one way or another, the banks are finished, either from Fintechs, or crypto, or both.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:30] The big ones around, and are kind of tech companies, anyway, but it is only regulatory capture, protecting them, at this point. Yeah. No. I mean, I think it is both, because payments, is quite different, from lots of other things, happening on the blockchain side. Right? Yeah. You know, savings, store of value, dapps. You're not gonna run dapps on Tempo.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[26:50] Mhmm.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[26:51] Yeah. Well, I, I mean, save you money, in Tempo coin.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[26:53] Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[26:54] I, I mean, I agree. There will not be a lot of, like, DeFi, on Tempo, for instance, sort of because it'd be too closed of an environment. You won't get the compositional aspect of things, probably, because they won't allow it. Like, I, I think, in theory, you could, but you won't. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[27:10] So, my view, is
