Okay, I need to process this raw transcript and create a clean, readable version while preserving all the content. Let me start by reading through the entire transcript to understand the context and the key points discussed. The speakers are talking about their early experiences with Ethereum, their meeting, the development of Ethereum, and the challenges of creating clients and the eventual launch.

First, I'll check the length of the input. The user mentioned that the output should be approximately the same length, so I need to make sure not to condense or summarize anything. Every dialogue point must remain.

Next, I need to apply the rules provided. The primary objective is to preserve all content, so I'll go through each line carefully. The critical content preservation rules include not removing any dialogue, technical explanations, anecdotes, etc. I'll need to correct technical terms, proper names, and ensure correct capitalization and punctuation.

Looking at the technical terms list, I'll check for any misspellings. For example, "etherium" should be "Ethereum", "bit coin" becomes "Bitcoin", and "solidity" should be "Solidity". Proper names like "Vitalik" or "Gavin Wood" need to be correctly spelled.

I'll also need to add timestamps at the beginning of each speaker's paragraph. The timestamps should be in [MM:SS] format, rounded to the nearest second. Since the original transcript doesn't have timestamps, I'll have to estimate them based on the flow of the conversation. I'll start with 00:00 for the first speaker and increment the time as the conversation progresses. However, since the exact timing isn't provided, I'll have to approximate the timestamps based on the length of each speaker's turns.

Another important rule is to merge consecutive speech into paragraphs. Each time a speaker changes, a new paragraph starts with the appropriate timestamp. I'll need to ensure that each paragraph is a single block of text without line breaks, separated by blank lines.

I'll also check for excessive filler words like "um", "uh", "you know", and "like" and remove them where they don't affect the meaning. False starts and repetitions should be cleaned up for readability. For example, "I was— I mean I was going to say..." can be corrected to "I was going to say...".

I need to be cautious not to alter the substance of the conversation. The speakers' anecdotes, technical discussions, and even the humorous parts should remain intact. For instance, the story about Vitalik throwing his shirt should be preserved as is.

I'll also verify that all technical terms are correctly capitalized and formatted. Terms like "EVM" (Ethereum Virtual Machine) should be in uppercase if that's the standard. Proper nouns like "ENS" (Ethereum Name Service) should be capitalized correctly.

After making these corrections, I'll ensure that the output format is correct: each speaker's paragraph starts with **[MM:SS] SPEAKER_XX:** followed by their dialogue, with blank lines between speakers.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure the output is within 90-110% of the input length. If it's significantly shorter, I might have removed too much content, so I'll need to review and restore any missing parts.

Throughout this process, I'll keep the user's instructions in mind, making sure not to add any new information or summaries, and strictly adhere to the provided rules for corrections and formatting.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Alrighty, so we're on. Thanks. So my name is Kieran James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James from OzDR and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Blockapps which has been in operation for quite some time. But that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space. And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened and so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for, for posterity and here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion. But we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational. This is a first of a, you know, Kieran produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one. So we're going to find out how it goes. Alrighty, so let's, let's start out with the question, when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start. And there's still a kicking myself aspect to it. So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011. So this would have been my senior year in undergrad of bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of 14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit. I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a paypl type provider, that sort of thing. And they might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. So that said, let me hand the question over to Jim. When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

**[02:15] SPEAKER_01:** Aware is different than like interested. In fact, like, I don't know, I was like, I came from an academic background so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But, but I was like a little bit too above all that, like, oh, that's like a money thing. I'm not interested in that money world. So really, no. Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who is a. An old friend of mine, and that Kieran had been following his blog. And Steve called me up and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing. And so at first I was like, yeah, you know, I'm not interested in all this, this fake money thing. And I went and I read the white paper, and by the end of the white paper, I was, I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about like, like banking or something. This is about incentivization on the Internet. And that drew me in. So. And at that point I. And there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I, I started, like, trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how that. And at the time it was a test net and. And that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there. So, I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

**[04:30] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, let's. Jim, we'll pick that up. I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological. So, you know, I was 2010, 2011, sounds like. Same time frame for you. I think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era and we'll talk in more detail. But let's, let's hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you want to take it?

**[05:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was, I was, you know, doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I. I felt really disconnected from North America. So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called Twit that was like all technical podcasts. And one of the podcasts I really love was this podcast Security now, which went really deep into these kind of like, security, technical kind of things and did like a couple episodes of bitcoin and I was like, you know, really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle, like, and even to the point where I downloaded the bitcoin client and ran it. Didn't get any bitcoin, where if I did, I didn't notice it. I wish. I think the Rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this. But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups there'd be like groups of computers in like part of their office. And I was like, what are those for? They're like, oh, we're mining bitcoin. And I was like, oh, like, why are you mining bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, you know, we can like transfer money and like, it's basically free Internet magic money. And I was like, I honestly was kind of repelled by that. Like, that kind of seemed like too nutty even for me at the time.

**[07:15] SPEAKER_01:** Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**[07:20] SPEAKER_00:** I never hated it. I was sort of just like not that interested, I guess. I know. I think, you know, from the east coast, the attitude towards like stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think Jimmy would long since been out in California doing like, yeah, you know, after your physics days.

**[07:45] SPEAKER_01:** You're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like, like, I guess I didn't hate it. I just felt I was too good for it.

**[08:00] SPEAKER_00:** I see.

**[08:10] SPEAKER_02:** I hate it. But I think I found the like, like everyone talked about. So I was fascinated. The technical aspect, like I said, like, you know, and it got me to read the white paper and even like download the software. But I think the part that kind of turned me off about was like when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who were setting up bitcoin mining rigs, they're like, they were like kind of fanatical. Like there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off. I would say.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it. But yeah, I think it's sort of. It was too fringe to attract like the classically most successful in some sense people at that time. Whereas, you know, fighting against, not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs like in math or physics or something. It's just like the most horsepower wins from a, you know, intellectual perspective and I guess the hardest working horsepower. Very few of those people got interested in, in, you know, crypto blockchain. A few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones as far as, you know, compared to younger ones like folks like Dan Benet, etc. But yeah, I think. I don't know that it was. That I was too good for it. But that one I didn't grasp right away. That it was revolutionary and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

**[11:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. I would describe my view of it in the early days was sketchy because most of the use cases that, like, I thought the technology was fascinating. But whenever I would ask about, you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case? Why would you use it? And people would describe, you know, things to circumvent existing laws. Like the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass, you know, foreign exchange rules and stuff. And I was like, is that legal? And like, no one would, you know, mention anything afterwards, basically.

**[12:15] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Well, I want to say good.

**[12:20] SPEAKER_01:** I got over feeling too good for it, I'll tell you that.

**[12:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, we all did. I want to touch on the other. The big thing that sticks out of my memory from the early blockchain era is, and we've kind of gone through this kind of cycle a couple times was Mount Gox. So Mount Gox was that first big price run up, I believe Bitcoin went from like 30 bucks, 1200 bucks in a pretty short time frame. And as we've seen in the last couple, you know, crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person to some extent. Consumer interest tracks with the price and people are getting excited about price momentum. Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts and someone is fleeced at the top, you know, and, you know, whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side, sort of. Crypto has somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound, but I guess the question is, do you guys remember Mount Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone, lots of people I knew who were not quite crypto savvy in the industry, etc, were suddenly paying attention when Mount Gox was happening.

**[14:30] SPEAKER_01:** I was just getting into things. I, I, what year was it? Was it 2015? 2014? 2014, probably. Right.

**[14:45] SPEAKER_00:** I think docs was 13. Let me check.

**[14:50] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, okay.

**[14:55] SPEAKER_01:** 13.

**[15:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[15:05] SPEAKER_01:** Okay. So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time. I was new enough to it that it was still, I was observing it as a, you know, like a third party, you know, it was, it was interesting to me. But, but yeah, I think I, I spent a little time to understand what, because you know, the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it. They didn't explain what was going on. So I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with Blockchain. It was. It was. Oh, there's.

**[16:30] SPEAKER_00:** I think you're right. So the run up was actually end of 13 into the beginning of 14, it looks like. Okay. So it officially shuttered February 2014 though. And the big. The 1200 that I remember was like November 2013, it looks like.

**[17:00] SPEAKER_02:** When did the hack happen?

**[17:05] SPEAKER_00:** December. Oh, I think right here.

**[17:10] SPEAKER_02:** Okay. Okay. Yeah, right there. Yeah.

**[17:15] SPEAKER_00:** So, yeah, interesting times for sure, because.

**[17:20] SPEAKER_02:** I think Monk Gox and. Oh, what was. I'm blanking right now. What. What was the name of that, you know, dark web marketplace that used Silk Road? Silk Road, Yeah. Like, I think it's. Those were kind of intertwined in those early days. Right. So I remember like even going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about. And I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there. Like, you know, lots of illicit stuff was listed there.

**[18:30] SPEAKER_00:** You know, that's.

**[18:35] SPEAKER_02:** Wow.

**[18:40] SPEAKER_00:** You know, I think I never did that. I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road. Just heard about it at like, I had to make Mt. Gox account and some others. There was a period where like, Dwala was doing crypto stuff and then I think they stopped and I believe they're still around as like a payment API company. But yeah, because I definitely use them and some others.

**[19:45] SPEAKER_02:** I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mount GOG hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other. And that was like the sort of like, you know, as you mentioned, like the first kind of iteration of like, oh, you know, all crypto and blockchain is dead now and then it just keeps coming back. Right?

**[20:30] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it sure does. Okay.

**[20:35] SPEAKER_01:** There's a little bit of bias in the new. The news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. Like if. If there's. If there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place. And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that, like, it might mean that there we need a little more regulation or something, but that that was a bad person. So it's always like much more tied into. You know, the price of. Of bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens. But you don't see like, the crashing because, like, somebody commits Fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess if the fraud's big enough. But.

**[22:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I agreed. Just segue. Yeah, segueing quickly. Can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first. And then we can do the whole. How we all.

**[22:15] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, Jim, do. Do I. Do I want to start or do you want to start?

**[22:20] SPEAKER_01:** I'll start.

**[22:25] SPEAKER_00:** And.

**[22:30] SPEAKER_01:** And I'll pass it over. I, actually, so I had. Back in the 90s, I was in academia and in the odds. I was in the startup world and I'd done a couple startups and I was ending one of my startups and I had two sons who were in the. Our local school in California was a Mandarin immersion school. And I. At this time, there was just a coincidence. Both my wife and I had ended jobs and we said, hey, let's do something crazy right now and let's. Let's take this to its extension. Let's go to China and actually put them in a school there. So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victors in Beijing. And he says, I'm going to get you in touch with these guys. So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now and you can explain.

**[24:00] SPEAKER_02:** Well, yeah, and so the vc, you know, who we're still friends with her g. Like, he kind of came up to me and he explicitly said, like, oh, I have this brilliant cto and he says he wants to come to China. I'm not sure how serious he is. So, you know, don't put all your eggs in this basket. But then we started talking that summer and you weren't like, traveling the country, so you were like in a different place every time.

**[25:15] SPEAKER_01:** Another advantage of us both being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving.

**[25:30] SPEAKER_02:** Around the country and. And I remember, like, you know, like we were kind of talking over the summer and I was like, you know, seeing how serious you were about coming and. And at one point you said, okay, look, if you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing. And I went to the school that my kids went to, which. And said, like, you know, can you make space for, you know, two foreign kids, this international program? They said, yes, if you can, but the kids have to be here the first day of school. And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation. So I called Jim up and said, look, I can do it. You know, I can guarantee a place for them but you have to be here on this day. And to my shock, he actually said yes. And he, like, parked up his house.

**[27:00] SPEAKER_01:** And like, everything in the house in, like, I think we had 12 days to be in school and we probably were. Had to have the house packed within, like. Like, I don't know, less than a week. So that was a crazy week. But. But Victor had a great help in, like, we were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about. Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything and he knew. He knew where the good schools were, he knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously. So, yeah, it was a great experience.

**[28:30] SPEAKER_02:** It was an exciting time to be in China. Was right around the first Olympics, you know, like, it was right around that, the Beijing Olympics. And so it was a really exciting time. But yeah, you wound up saying for about 18 months. Right. In total and a little less.

**[29:00] SPEAKER_01:** But yeah, it was. It was over a year.

**[29:05] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. And then we just kept in touch from there. Like, we loved working together.

**[29:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it was great year. Did you arrive? What was this? Rough times, your period? Yeah.

**[29:20] SPEAKER_01:** Who are you asking? Because it was different.

**[29:25] SPEAKER_00:** You, Jim.

**[29:30] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, 2011, Summer, we're driving all over the country. 2011, September, August, I can't remember. We were. We were in Beijing.

**[29:45] SPEAKER_00:** Gotcha. Gotcha. Very cool. And so then you're back end of 2012 or early 2013, something like that.

**[30:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, we were back at. When did we come back? I guess we were back in the country in 2013.

**[30:15] SPEAKER_00:** Gotcha.

**[30:20] SPEAKER_01:** But like, January.

**[30:25] SPEAKER_00:** Let me actually, I'll segue. I'm trying to keep it slightly chronological to keep, you know, everything in my mind here consistent. So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. I got to start working on Ethereum, kind of purely by accident. Maybe not purely by accident, but basically.

**[31:00] SPEAKER_02:** The.

**[31:05] SPEAKER_00:** I had passed my qualifying exam. I'm going to say spring 2014 or, you know, maybe May, April or May 2014. So for those who have not. Not aware of how PhD program works, qualifying exam is like one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis. So sometimes it's a coursework requirement. Sometimes you need to, you know, translate a work from, like an academic work from one language to. To another to show proficiency. I think most of them have dropped those requirements at this point. And so, you know, it's a whole bunch of study tense prep at Berkeley. It's a three hour oral exam with a couple people from your department and one from an external department. And then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass, thankfully. It was a. I don't know that it was.

**[33:00] SPEAKER_02:** It was.

**[33:05] SPEAKER_00:** Everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good. Right? Like, and, you know, so while I passed it, I gives like, you know, didn't feel great at least the rest of that day.

**[33:20] SPEAKER_02:** When did you find out the result? Like, immediately. Oh, you do? Okay.

**[33:25] SPEAKER_00:** You put you in the hall and they tell you, yeah, okay, that's good. So you're just like very nervous.

**[33:30] SPEAKER_01:** I don't know what it was like for you, but for me it was just like three guys I knew and I was nervous too, but it wasn't like they had to go and like, you know, like calculate numbers or something. They just kind of come out and they're like, yeah, yeah, exactly.

**[33:45] SPEAKER_00:** No, it was like that. Right? Yeah, it's, it's a oral. It's subjective in a sense, but, you know, there you've got like several of the world's foremost experts, you know, in some subjects, so they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research. So anyway, so kind of a. The qualifying exam led to, you know, I needed like a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics and I had almost taken a job working for sort of a data science company that was taking, I can't quite remember, so something having to do with like Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks. I can't, can't remember at this time, but, you know, it seemed like an okay thing. I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I'm from New York and, you know, as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture and I didn't fully do it. I still, you know, I'm prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kind of like it there. But anyway, by the way, yes, yes, Jim's there. I'm in the state of New York at the moment.

**[36:00] SPEAKER_02:** But.

**[36:05] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, but I, you know, I need a little break basically. And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project. So somehow my, you know, I guess I'll go into this somehow. My dad, Joe Lubin, got attached to the project basically because he was always. He was tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time. He had a CS background, plus the financial background. Ran a hedge fund for a number of years. And so it's just kind of always watching technological innovations in financial services. And I guess always had a little bit of the blockchain philosophical character in that, let's say, pro freedom, little bit of a libertarian streak kind of thing. And I believe he happened to just be visiting our families. He's from Toronto. A lot of, A lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. And he went, I believe, to. It might have been a bitcoin meetup at that time or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup. But this would have been January, February 2014, I believe. And Vitalik was speaking there. And you know, like everyone around that time where you see Vitalik speak about something, you got really excited, right? And so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away. He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project. And you know, it didn't turn out that way. We can go into it a little bit later. But he started working on it again, let's say February, March 2014. And so he just sent me the white paper, like right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam, I got a chance to read it and it was pretty cool and interesting and new and that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of the technology and it caused me to go back and read the bitcoin white paper, et cetera. And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer basically. So that's how I got into it. And subsequently Jim alluded to this earlier. I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Hsu, great, great friend of ours, kind of, I don't know, not quite famously brilliant, definitely brilliant, somewhat famous, super cool guy and had been a long time reader of Steve's blog. He's one of the few really excellent kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy, but most people who are really technical in communication have a hard time, I don't know, distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience. But Steve is actually good at that, but with nuanced coverage of technical topics. So anyway, caught up with Steve and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim. And I believe I was the first time I spoke to Steve I was in New York, but was just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe January, sorry, June, July 2014, and maybe I came back in August or something like that. And it turned out that, you know, Jim was there in, in Hayward and we got to meet up. What do you think? August 2014, September, something like that?

**[40:00] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, it was around then because also ironically, I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back.

**[40:15] SPEAKER_02:** That's all Your big life changes are related to some cross country trip ob.

**[40:20] SPEAKER_00:** Soul searching. You do a literal search around the country.

**[40:25] SPEAKER_01:** Well, see, I was in Montana and then I was back in the Bay Area and then we talked.

**[40:30] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, okay, that's cool. How was Montana, by the way?

**[40:35] SPEAKER_01:** Wow.

**[40:40] SPEAKER_00:** Maybe we shouldn't go. Yeah, Montana. Oddly crypto friendly.

**[40:45] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, yeah, makes sense. Big sky country, right? Big sky country.

**[40:50] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, so let me see here. I want to. I have a couple other 2014 anecdotes that you guys may not even know that much about, but maybe we should jump ahead to 2015 and go back.

**[41:15] SPEAKER_02:** Just before we go past 2014. So I moved back from China in 2014. And so, you know, me and Jim were talking about like, oh, now that we were, I was back, what kind of project could we do together? So while you had started that conversation, me and Jim were like thinking about, okay, you know, like, maybe we could work on a startup together. And at some point you forwarded me the paper as well. So like, I think once. So that's, that's kind of how I got into it as well.

**[42:30] SPEAKER_00:** I want to give. Yeah, I don't want to speak the whole time, but. But I have some info here that I forget if I told you guys at length.

**[42:45] SPEAKER_02:** Okay.

**[42:50] SPEAKER_00:** So in 2014, so basically I did work on the Ethereum project through a bunch of 2014. As far as tech projects go, it was much more global, a little more European, but you know, you had Canada, you got a, had a bunch of people in Zug, Switzerland, a little bit in Israel. In the early days, we worked out of an office, my dad and I and guy named Stephen Nureyev, who is now kind of famous actually, if you Google the name, you know, it's. It's definitely an interesting and colorful story that I'll go into a little bit, and a guy named Jonathan whose last name I couldn't find when I was writing this down, but Jonathan's a good guy. And I don't know if they kind of parted ways at some point or how that all happened. So we're working in this office in Times Square and really trying to find different ways to advance the project, meeting with lots of people. So, you know, that's When I met Steve Hsu, who introduced me to Jim, basically just kind of calling up whoever might be interested. But part of the plans that the Ethereum folks had was they acknowledged that there would be a need for kind of ongoing pure research and then in addition to more like focused R and D to build the network out. And so Vitalik at some point penned an article about 10 hard problems in cryptocurrency or something of that nature in which, and I think it was, if we went back now, it would look both very insightful and a little bit dated. I'm sure some of them have been solved and some of them may not need to be solved because something else emerged. But basically he foresaw the need for privacy above and beyond pseudonymity. For instance, many things with that transition from proof of work to proof of stake or just energy efficient blockchains which people were talking about at that time. But my position in academia at that time seemed to be helpful as the, the blockchain people were just so different from the academia people. Despite being like, both of them being really smart groups of people, blockchain people were not worried about doing things through the proper channels and approval and writing it up the right way and all that sort of thing. Whereas something about academia makes you fearful of being wrong because you're wrong enough in public, there are kind of consequences for it. And the kind of, I would say the tech attitude in general is like getting something out there, you know, get it to work basically, but get it out. And then iterate and blockchain people had that, you know, in a extreme. And I would say also Ethereum was much more like that than the Bitcoin culture. The Bitcoin culture was like a bunch of practicing but academic cryptographers who never wanted to change anything. And the Ethereum people were more like have like the software, computer science, engineering attitude of like, well, let's get it out there, let's, let's tinker with it, let's kind of see what happens. And there's good arguments for both, especially when you're talking about like a system that custodies, well, not custody, but you know, that records a lot of high value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred. But all that is to say it was useful for the Ethereum foundation to have sort of someone who was actively in academia to kind of work with and coordinate everything. So we agreed to work on a body called the Cryptocurrency Research Group and that was composed of sort of myself, Vitalik and our friend Aaron Wright. Was kind of. He's since gone on to a number of Web3 projects, but at the time was a practicing attorney, but also a professor at Cardozo Law School. And he came to that Times Square office, which was, you know, not the greatest of offices, I would say, and just sort of really leaned in on Ethereum and kind of helped structure everything so that it would be kind of the most robust. Not just technology, but they actually did kind of a quite good job in figuring out how to set things up that other projects since did, you know, certainly did not do as good a job, I'll say. So it was funny Times. And in 2014, I also got to go to Zug. For those who don't know, the Ethereum foundation was one of the first to be headquartered in Switzerland. And it was kind of. It's become a very popular choice for crypto foundations because I guess the Ethereum foundation sort of blazed a path. And. Okay, funny thing about Switzerland is that the kind of local authorities also seem like business people. Like, they want to land the future tax revenue and employment. And so you can kind of, once Switzerland is split into some number of cantons, which are like states, a little smaller than US States, of course. And so you can kind of go from Canton to Canton and try to get the best offer. And offer really means like, you know, tax treatment, any kind of grants, or just like, you know, and helping get fast answers around legal questions. You know, one of the tough things about the United States is that sometimes you don't know what's allowed. And the Swiss environment, they were fairly clear, you know, about what, what they wanted for the special tax treatment and, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

**[48:00] SPEAKER_02:** So.

**[48:05] SPEAKER_00:** So we went out and visited Zoog, I don't know, mid late summer 2014. And I got to meet all of the founders of Ethereum at that time. I believe there are kind of eight in total. And, you know, so I think those.

**[48:30] SPEAKER_01:** Numbers changed over time, though.

**[48:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, those numbers changed, yes. So.

**[48:40] SPEAKER_01:** Well, but.

**[48:45] SPEAKER_00:** But, yeah, I think so. I don't exactly know how all of it happened, but, you know, Vitalik, it was always a global project, right? So Vitalik would kind of go around the world and evangelize, get people excited, and they would want to work with the project. And so a bunch of folks got attached to it. And, you know, I think obviously it worked, right? But if he were to do it again, I bet he would be a little bit more careful about adding folks to it, because 8 is just like too many. Like, if you Went to a US venture capitalist with a slide that says eight co founders. And they're not all, you know, currently running billion dollar companies. You'd be just laughed out of the room. And yet it, it worked, right? It actually functioned. And the, you know, so kind of the way it broke apart was that there were like the technical element, technical guys. So I think, I don't quite know how this happened but pretty early on, like Gavin Wood, Jeff Wilkie started building out versions of Ethereum, the C and Go clients specifically. We'll go into the client soon because there's good stories there. Vitalik was building the Python client. They were all working together on technical documentation. And the reason that people were building multiple clients was that there was the perception that bitcoin was controlled and centralized because there's only really one definitive client Bitcoin D. Right. And so there was this kind of huge replication of technical effort. Like each of them eventually got their own teams. There were JavaScript clients, many of them kind of came out later and I'd say the project, so the project had sort of tech folks and business folks. Like, like any tech project didn't really have a nominal CEO at any time. It was closest to being Charles Hoskinson. So I think at the time I went to Zug, the leadership looked like on the business side, Charles is the CEO Amir Chitreat who is really kind of did business development. He's a funny guy. I still see him every once in a while. Joe, my dad and Anthony DiIorio as the other business guys who probably had the most operating experience. And then the tech side was Vitalik, Jeff Gavin and then Mihaly had sort of done corporate setup. I believe Mihaly worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin magazine. So Vitalik, very interesting character where most of the time your technical geniuses are not good communicators. And he was sort of a journalist running Bitcoin magazine, writing a lot of the articles. If he started it or kind of joined it and you know, he would, he would. I think he kind of crowdfunded the articles a little bit. Like for, you know, if I can get a pledge of one bitcoin, I'll write an article about X, you know. And at the time of Bitcoin was inexpensive but you know those, those values went up and I, I think it actually ended up being a good funding mechanism, you know, the articles he wrote in the future and it led him to kind of have a sort of impartial thought leader position in addition to his really strong technical Ability and the ideas he was generating, etc. And I know he had joined a bunch of projects early on and helped work with them. Like I think Master Coin was maybe the first colored coin project. He did some work on that. So anyway, so those were the eight at the time and there was a meeting for everyone to kind of get on the same page, you know, remote project. There was a slack. People were maybe working a little bit at cross purposes, lots of infighting. People are stressed, they're trying to deliver on this like awesome concept that Vitalik put out there. And then everyone kind of tried to grab ownership of like was there a reason to have all these different clients? You know, in the end, empirically it worked, right? But a little bit of it was a I want, you know, Ethereum to be mine sort of thing. And I saw this in the room when we were visiting there. So basically on this, this trip everyone went outside at some point and people were kind of a little bit sick. The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing to some extent. There's always this tension probably especially early in a company where the tech people are like, what do I need you business guy for? We're going to make this thing and it's going to get out there and the business people have to go raise the money, find sales, find partnerships, etc. And it's subjective stuff that the tech people don't like or sometimes understand. And more or less this happened. You know, people were uncomfortable with kind of promises that Charles was making and just the accusations. I don't really even, you know, I, I know Charles some, but I don't even really know what was going on at that time. But there was this general sense of frustration with him. He also seems to be in some ways executing well on like a effective smart business strategy, but maybe over promising what's possible to the point of bringing people out. And then we kind of seen later, you know, I think some of the stuff with Cardano was probably at least aggressive I would say, but that, you know, the jury was not out at that time in my eyes. Right. And Amir also was in target because I think people just thought he wasn't doing enough, it sounded like. And so they were both jettisoned from the project in Zug, you know, and I was like, they were like out on the terrace. It's like they had like a nice sort of loft that they rented that was like the Ethereum dev house in Zug. And so I'm like watching this happen and you know, it was kind of quite crazy. And then actually they instated two more co founders, so to speak, right then who kind of jumped on board the project and helped out. It was, it was like a fun and kind of crazy trip. Otherwise, you know, we went out in Zurich, some people got in trouble with the cops. I won't add more detail to that, but Zurich's a funny place where in the US we're not used to people drinking on the street. And in Zurich everyone drinks on the street and few people are in the bars, you know, so it was a strange experience. We went on some hikes. You know, it's, it's a very nice part of the world, Switzerland, but plenty of drama. You know, in the early days I remember having a funny conversation with Mihai about like he had this book about like swarm behavior and you know, he learned I had a mathematical background. We're talking about like the mathematics of swarms and all that sort of thing. But yeah, the, the, it felt nascent, intense, but disorganized. They were also grappling with the decision on initially they wanted to have a non profit protocol and a for profit, they called it a crypto Google at the time to sort of monetize the nonprofit protocol. And plenty of blockchain companies have gone and done that sort of thing subsequently. But that was also decided at that meeting that they would be all not for profit.

**[54:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[54:05] SPEAKER_00:** And people didn't like it. You know, some folks started talking about Brain Drain. It was a mix. Some people liked it, some, some didn't. Sort of the threat being like if you don't do this for profit, like I'm going to leave this, this project kind of thing. And I think about everyone sort of went off and did start their own businesses. So you know, it is what it is. But anyways, let me, let me pause and see if you guys. Did I tell this whole story, you know, to you guys at any point?

**[55:15] SPEAKER_02:** I, I think you told parts of it and not the entire thing, but yes, I, I didn't realize the sort of Game of Thrones aspect happened in all of that period, short period of time, you know, that like I, I, I knew that all that had happened behind the scenes.

**[55:30] SPEAKER_00:** I think it was all like, I think it was going on continually. But it came to a head all in this one meeting, a sort of a funny memory. We so Bitcoin Suisse was getting off the ground at that time and we met with a guy named Nicholas.

**[55:45] SPEAKER_02:** Who.

**[55:50] SPEAKER_00:** Maybe was the CEO or one of the founders. I just googled it says founder and there's a different CEO now. But he made this funny. He's a nice guy and I think something happened there. I'm not quite sure. He made this funny comment. We were in an elevator. This shows the difference between the American and Swiss attitude. We're in an elevator and it was one of the ones where it's kind of hand operated and you do it yourself and it's just like the door could just easily close on you. And I was like, wow, we'd never have this in the US because we're so litigious. And they said, well, yeah, Swiss attitude, natural selection. Anyways.

**[57:00] SPEAKER_01:** I know sometimes I think things get grandfathered in. Like some of those subway platforms in New York are pretty terrifying too.

**[57:05] SPEAKER_00:** They are certainly. Yeah. It could just be that it's older there.

**[57:10] SPEAKER_01:** Right?

**[57:15] SPEAKER_00:** That makes sense. But yes, I think the big. Other than. So Zoog, you know, basically what we saw or let me see, there was growing momentum around the project. Lots of people all over the world kind of working on it. Stuff was probably not tightly papered. You know, there's no like employment agreements. Probably at that time it was like. But there was really intense excitement and I think the belief that everyone was going to be mega successful out of it, like one way or another, you know, it's been kind of interesting to watch. Jim, do you want to talk about getting into it? And I alluded to all the different clients of Ethereum and the reason why there was more than one. Do you want to tell your report of that part now?

**[58:30] SPEAKER_01:** Well, this part of the story, when you were doing all that stuff, I was too busy driving around the country. But I came back.

**[58:45] SPEAKER_00:** It comes in a little later. Two, three months later. Right. Or the rest.

**[58:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, right. At the end of the summer.

**[58:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[59:00] SPEAKER_01:** When you were coming back? I think so. And that's when, when I got really interested in it. I remember like the whole culture. So I got, I got fascinated with the technology. When I read the white paper, that's when I realized this was something. Something big. And I wanted to immerse myself into the world a little bit. But it was a. It was a foreign culture to me. Like we, we decided to. So Natasha, my wife and I, we decided just to see what, what this world was like. We'd buy, try, try buying a little bitcoin. And I remember we sort of. We looked a little bit at the various ways to do it. And the way we decided on was to meet Some, someone in a coffee shop in the middle of Berkeley. And we got there and he was told, totally the stereotype. The dude was walking around with like the, the five toed shoes. And we kind of like it, it all felt very salacious. We walked in with this packet of money in our hands and we had to like meet this guy and he spent most of the time like.

**[60:30] SPEAKER_00:** Do you remember, did you use like local bitcoins? That was popular. I don't know if it's still in existence. Local bitcoins. Okay, gotcha. Sorry. Go ahead, Jim.

**[60:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, he, he spent most of the time there railing against the government and how, how much he hated the, the US government and all the things they, the, you know, all the, all the terrible things they were doing. And, and we kind of like. We looked a little bit at the various ways to do it. And the way we decided on was to meet Some, someone in a coffee shop in the middle of Berkeley.
