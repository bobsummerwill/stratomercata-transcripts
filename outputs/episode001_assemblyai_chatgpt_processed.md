**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Alrighty, so we're on.
[00:02] Thanks.
[00:03] So my name is Kieran James Lubin.
[00:05] I'm joined by Jim or James from OzDR and Victor Wong.
[00:09] We are old friends.
[00:10] We also run a company together called BlockApps, which has been in operation for quite some time.
[00:14] But that's not what we're here to talk about today.
[00:16] We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days.
[00:20] So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.
[00:29] And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened, and so we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity, and here we are.
[00:37] So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion.
[00:40] But we, you know, we're not trying to be formal here, trying to make it conversational.
[00:43] This is a first of a, you know, Kieran-produced podcast of sorts.
[00:46] I've been on a bunch of them.
[00:47] I don't think I've ever led one.
[00:49] So we're going to find out how it goes.
[00:51] Alrighty, so let's start out with the question: when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular?
[00:56] I'll give my answer to start.
[00:58] And there's still a kicking-myself aspect to it.
[01:00] So I became aware, I'm going to say 2010, possibly 2011.
[01:04] So this would have been my senior year in undergrad of Bitcoin.
[01:07] And I distinctly remember it being $3, down from a recent peak of $14 or $15.
[01:12] I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit.
[01:15] I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time.
[01:18] I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution.
[01:21] If you asked me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal-type provider, that sort of thing.
[01:26] And I might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.
[01:30] So that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.
[01:32] When were you first aware of Bitcoin?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:34] Aware is different than interested.
[01:36] In fact, like, I don't know, I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it.
[01:42] But I was like a little bit too above all that, like, "Oh, that's like a money thing.
[01:46] I'm not interested in that money world."
[01:48] So really, no.
[01:49] The interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who is an old friend of mine, and that Kieran had been following his blog.
[01:55] And Steve called me up and he's like, "This guy Kieran just called me up and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing."
[02:00] And so at first I was like, "Yeah, you know, I'm not interested in all this fake money thing."
[02:04] And I went and I read the white paper, and by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in.
[02:08] I was like, "This isn't just about banking or something.
[02:11] This is about incentivization on the Internet."
[02:13] And that drew me in.
[02:14] And at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed, I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked.
[02:20] So that's when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how that...
[02:25] And at the time it was a testnet.
[02:27] And that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there.
[02:31] So, I don't know.
[02:32] Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:34] Yeah, let's...
[02:35] Jim, we'll pick that up.
[02:36] I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological.
[02:38] So, you know, I was 2010, 2011.
[02:40] Sounds like same timeframe for you.
[02:42] I think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era and we'll talk in more detail.
[02:46] But let's hold on it for just a moment.
[02:48] Vic, do you want to take it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[02:50] Yeah.
[02:51] I think I became aware of it around the same time as you.
[02:54] I was doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I felt really disconnected from North America.
[03:00] So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts.
[03:03] And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called Twit that was like all technical podcasts.
[03:08] And one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast "Security Now," which went really deep into these kind of security, technical kind of things and did like a couple episodes of Bitcoin.
[03:17] And I was like really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle.
[03:21] And even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it.
[03:25] Didn't get any Bitcoin, or if I did, I didn't notice it.
[03:28] I wish.
[03:29] I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this.
[03:32] But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups there'd be like groups of computers in part of their office.
[03:39] And I was like, "What are those for?"
[03:41] They're like, "Oh, we're mining Bitcoin."
[03:43] And I was like, "Oh, like, why are you mining Bitcoin?"
[03:46] And they're like, "Oh, well, you know, we can transfer money and it's basically free Internet magic money."
[03:51] And I was like, I honestly was kind of repelled by that.
[03:54] Like, that kind of seemed like too nutty even for me at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:57] Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:59] I never hated it.
[04:00] I was sort of just like not that interested, I guess.
[04:03] I think, you know, from the East Coast, the attitude towards stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable.
[04:08] I think Jimmy would long since been out in California doing like, yeah, you know, after your physics days.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:13] You're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of like...
[04:16] I guess I didn't hate it.
[04:17] I just felt I was too good for it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:19] I see.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:20] I hated it.
[04:21] But I think I found the...
[04:22] Like everyone talked about...
[04:23] So I was fascinated with the technical aspect, like I said.
[04:26] And it got me to read the white paper and even download the software.
[04:30] But I think the part that kind of turned me off about it was like when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs, they were kind of fanatical.
[04:38] Like there was that crypto-anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:44] Yeah, Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were going to get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto.
[04:54] Some of them weighed in on it.
[04:56] But yeah, I think it was too fringe to attract the classically most successful, in some sense, people at that time.
[05:03] Whereas, you know, fighting against—not fighting against—but you're sort of fighting for jobs in math or physics or something.
[05:09] It's just like the most horsepower wins from an intellectual perspective, and I guess the hardest working horsepower.
[05:15] Very few of those people got interested in crypto, blockchain.
[05:18] A few cryptographers certainly did, and probably actually more established ones as far as compared to younger ones, like folks like Dan Boneh, etc.
[05:26] But yeah, I think...
[05:27] I don't know that it was that I was too good for it, but that one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[05:36] Yeah.
[05:37] I would describe my view of it in the early days was sketchy because most of the use cases that...
[05:41] Like, I thought the technology was fascinating.
[05:43] But whenever I would ask about...
[05:45] You know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, "What's the use case?
[05:48] Why would you use it?"
[05:49] And people would describe things to circumvent existing laws.
[05:52] Like the big one in China that I remember is like, "Oh, I can transfer money and bypass foreign exchange rules and stuff."
[05:58] And I was like, "Is that legal?"
[06:00] And no one would mention anything afterwards, basically.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:03] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:04] Well, I got over feeling too good for it, I'll tell you that.
