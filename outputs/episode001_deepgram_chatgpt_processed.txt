**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Alrighty.
[00:01] So we're on. Thanks.
[00:03] So, my name is Kieran James Lubin.
[00:06] I'm joined by Jim—or James—from SDR and Victor Wong.
[00:10] We are old friends.
[00:12] We also run a company together called BlockApps, which has been in operation for quite some time.
[00:17] But that's not what we're here to talk about today.
[00:20] We're actually taking up the topic of what Ethereum was like in the early days.
[00:24] So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.
[00:34] And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened.
[00:37] So we wanted to kind of, you know, get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity, and here we are.
[00:43] So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we're not trying to be formal here.
[00:48] Trying to make it conversational.
[00:50] This is the first of a Kieran-produced podcast of sorts.
[00:54] I've been on a bunch of them.
[00:56] I don't think I've ever led one, so we're gonna find out how it goes.
[00:59] Alrighty. So let's start out with the question:
[01:03] When were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular?
[01:07] I'll give my answer to start.
[01:09] And there's still a kicking-myself aspect to it.
[01:12] So I became aware—I'm gonna say 2010, possibly 2011.
[01:17] So this would have been my senior year in undergrad—of Bitcoin.
[01:21] And I distinctly remember it being $3, down from a recent peak of $14 or $15.
[01:26] I thought it was interesting and, you know, looked into it a little bit.
[01:30] I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time.
[01:33] I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution.
[01:37] You know, if you asked me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and, you know, digital banking or a PayPal-type provider, that sort of thing.
[01:45] And I might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course.
[01:49] So, that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:53] When were you first aware of Bitcoin?
[01:55] Aware is different than, like, interested.
[01:58] In fact, like, I don't know.
[02:00] I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it.
[02:05] But I was, like, a little bit too above all that.
[02:08] Like, "Oh, that's like a money thing. I'm not interested in that money world."
[02:12] So, really, no.
[02:14] Like, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who was an old friend of mine, and Kieran had been following his blog.
[02:21] And Steve called me up, and he's like, "This guy Kieran just called me up, and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing."
[02:27] And so, at first, I was like, "Yeah, you know, I'm not interested in all this fake money thing."
[02:32] And I went and I read the white paper.
[02:34] And by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in.
[02:37] I was like, "This isn't just about banking or something. This is about incentivization on the Internet," and that drew me in.
[02:44] So at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed.
[02:49] I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked.
[02:52] So that's when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers.
[02:56] And at the time, it was a testnet.
[02:58] And that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there.
[03:03] So, well, I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:06] Yeah. Let's—Jim, we'll pick that up.
[03:08] I'm trying to a little bit stay chronological.
[03:10] So, you know, 2010, 2011 sounds like same time frame for you.
[03:14] I think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era, and we'll talk in more detail.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[03:20] But let's hold on it for just a moment.
[03:22] Vic, do you wanna take it?
[03:24] Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you.
[03:27] I was doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I felt really disconnected from North America.
[03:33] So I became sort of an early fan of podcasts.
[03:36] And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWiT that was, like, all technical podcasts.
[03:41] And one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast, Security Now, which went really deep into these kind of, like, security technical kind of things.
[03:48] And he did, like, a couple episodes on Bitcoin.
[03:51] And I was really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle.
[03:55] Like, even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it.
[03:59] Didn't get any Bitcoin—or if I did, I didn't notice it.
[04:02] I wish—I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this.
[04:06] But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups, there'd be, like, groups of computers in part of their office.
[04:13] And I was like, "What are those for?"
[04:15] And they're like, "Oh, we're mining Bitcoin."
[04:17] And I was like, "Oh, like, why are you mining Bitcoin?"
[04:20] And they're like, "Oh, well, you know, we can transfer money and it's basically free Internet magic money."
[04:25] And I was like—I honestly was kind of repelled by that.
[04:28] Like, that kind of seemed too nutty even for me at the time.
[04:31] Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:34] I never hated it.
[04:35] I was sort of just, like, not that interested, I guess.
[04:38] You know, I think from the East Coast, the attitude towards stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable.
[04:44] I think Jimmy had long since been out in California doing—yeah, you know, after your physics days.
[04:49] But when doing grad stuff, you're not telling me that there were other grad students who kind of—like, I guess I didn't hate it.
[04:54] I just felt I was too good for it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:56] I see. I didn't hate it, but I think I found the—like, everyone talked about—so I was fascinated by the technical aspect, like I said.
[05:03] And it got me to read the white paper and even download the software.
[05:06] But I think the part that kind of turned me off a bit was, like, when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, like, who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs, they were kind of fanatical.
[05:14] Like, there was that crypto-anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say.
[05:19] Yeah. Jim, I would say—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:21] The people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were gonna get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto.
[05:30] Some of them weighed in on it.
[05:32] But, yeah, I think it was too fringe to attract the classically most successful, in some sense, people at that time.
[05:39] Whereas, you know, fighting against—not fighting against, but you're sort of fighting for jobs in math or physics or something.
[05:45] It's just like the most horsepower wins from an intellectual perspective and, I guess, the hardest-working horsepower.
[05:51] Very few of those people got interested in crypto or blockchain.
[05:55] A few cryptographers certainly did, and probably actually more established ones as far as compared to younger ones—like folks like Dan Boneh, etc.
[06:03] But, yeah, I think—I don't know that it was that I was too good for it, but that, one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary.
[06:11] And I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.
[06:15] Yeah. I would describe my view of it in the early days as—
