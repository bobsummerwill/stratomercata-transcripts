# Ethereum Early Days: A Founders' Retrospective

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:00] Alrighty. So we're on. Thanks. So my name is Kieran James Lubin. I'm joined by Jim or James from SDR and Victor Wong. We are old friends. We also run a company together called Block Apps, which has been in operation for quite some time, but that's not what we're here to talk about today.

[00:30] We're actually taking the topic up of what Ethereum was like in the early days. So we've all had both an insider and an outsider perspective on Ethereum and enjoyed the really crazy and wild ride that has been in the last approximately decade in the blockchain space.

[00:52] And sometimes we forget all of the interesting things that happened. And so we wanted to kind of get in front of a camera and get it all down for posterity, and here we are. So with that said, I'll kind of take the lead on the discussion, but we're not trying to be formal here. Trying to make it conversational.

[01:18] This is a first of a currently produced podcast of sorts. I've been on a bunch of them. I don't think I've ever led one, so we're gonna find out how it goes. Alrighty. So let's start out with the question: when were you first aware of Bitcoin and blockchain in particular? I'll give my answer to start, and there's still a kicking myself aspect to it.

[01:47] So I became aware, I'm gonna say 2010, possibly 2011, so this would have been my senior year in undergrad, of Bitcoin. And I distinctly remember it being $3 down from a recent peak of $14 or $15. I thought it was interesting and looked into it a little bit.

[02:12] I didn't really get the idea of decentralization at the time. I just imagined it as some sort of digital money solution. If you asked me then, I probably couldn't have drawn a difference between it and digital banking or a PayPal-type provider, that sort of thing.

[02:35] And I might have bought a little of it, but not nearly enough, of course. So that said, let me hand the question over to Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:47] When were you first aware of Bitcoin? Where is different than interested? In fact, I came from an academic background, so I'd been hearing about it probably since when you had been hearing about it. But I was a little bit too above all that. Like, oh, that's like a money thing. I'm not interested in that money world.

[03:15] So really, the interest came from when you reached out to Steve, who was an old friend of mine, and Kieran had been following his blog. And Steve called me up, and he's like, this guy Kieran just called me up, and you have to go look at this Ethereum thing.

[03:38] And so at first, I was like, yeah, I'm not interested in all this fake money thing. And I went and I read the white paper. And by the end of the white paper, I was hooked in. I was like, this isn't just about banking or something. This is about incentivization on the Internet, and that drew me in.

[04:02] And at that point, there was enough ambiguous stuff being discussed. I wanted to just dig in and see how it worked. So that's when I started trying to write code that would connect to one of the peers and see how they worked. At the time, it was a test net. And that's when I started to understand the background of it and got really pulled into there.

[04:30] So, well, I don't know. Let me pass it on to Victor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:35] Yeah. Let's, Jim, we'll pick that up. I'm trying to stay a little bit chronological, so 2010, 2011 sounds like same time frame for you. I think we'll pull back in a question or two right to that era, and we'll talk in more detail. But let's hold on it for just a moment. Vic, do you wanna take it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[04:58] Yeah. I think I became aware of it around the same time as you. I was doing one of my startups in Beijing at the time, and I felt really disconnected from North America, so I became sort of an early fan of podcasts. And one of the big podcast networks was this thing called TWiT that was all technical podcasts.

[05:24] And one of the podcasts I really loved was this podcast, Security Now, which went really deep into these kind of security technical things. And he did a couple episodes on Bitcoin. And I was really, really fascinated by it, but mostly from a technical angle.

[05:46] And even to the point where I downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it, didn't get any Bitcoin. Or if I did, I didn't notice it. I think the rewards were like 50 at the time or something like this. But the strange thing was that a year or two later, I started to notice at other Chinese startups, there'd be groups of computers in part of their office.

[06:12] And I was like, what are those for? And they're like, oh, we're mining Bitcoin. And I was like, oh, why are you mining Bitcoin? And they're like, oh, well, you can transfer money and it's basically free Internet magic money. And I was like, I honestly was kind of repelled by that. Like, that seemed too nutty even for me at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:38] Did we all hate it before we liked it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[06:41] I never hated it. I was sort of just not that interested, I guess.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:47] I think from the East Coast, the attitude towards stiff financial stuff is probably more favorable. I think, Jimmy, you'd long since been out in California doing grad stuff. You're not telling me that there were other grad students who kinda liked it?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:05] I guess I didn't hate it. I just felt I was too good for it.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[07:10] I see. I didn't hate it, but I think I found the technical aspect fascinating, like I said. I even downloaded the software. But I think the part that kind of turned me off a bit was when you talk to some of the early people that I would ask, who were setting up Bitcoin mining rigs, they were kind of fanatical.

[07:37] Like, there was that crypto anarchist sort of flavor to the early days that kind of turned me off, I would say.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:44] Yeah. Jim, I would say the people in academia that were pretty successful on a classic track and were gonna get a good postdoc and a good assistant professorship and all that sort of thing mostly ignored crypto. Some of them weighed in on it, but yeah, I think it was too fringe to attract the classically most successful in some sense people at that time.

[08:14] Whereas, fighting for jobs in math or physics or something, it's just the most horsepower wins from an intellectual perspective and, I guess, the hardest working horsepower. Very few of those people got interested in crypto blockchain.

[08:37] A few cryptographers certainly did and probably actually more established ones as far as compared to younger ones, like folks like Dan Boneh, etcetera. But yeah, I think I don't know that it was that I was too good for it, but one, I didn't grasp right away that it was revolutionary, and I didn't see anyone near me leaning into it for a while, I guess.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[09:05] Yeah. I would describe my view of it in the early days was sketchy because most of the use cases, I thought the technology was fascinating, but whenever I would ask, you know, I'm a product guy, so I would always ask, like, what's the use case? Why would you use it?

[09:26] And people would describe things to circumvent existing laws. Like, the big one in China that I remember is like, oh, I can transfer money and bypass foreign exchange rules and stuff. So I was like, is that legal? And no one would mention anything afterwards, basically.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:47] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:48] Well, I wanna say I got— Sorry.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[09:51] I got over feeling too good for it. I'll tell you that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[09:55] Yeah. And we all did it. Yeah. I wanna touch on the other big thing that sticks out of my memory from the early blockchain era, and we've kinda gone through this kind of cycle a couple times, was Mt. Gox. So Mt. Gox was that first big price run up.

[10:18] I believe Bitcoin went from like $30 to $1,200 in a pretty short time frame. And as we've seen in the last couple crypto, you could call them asset bubbles if you were a cynical person. To some extent, consumer interest tracks with the price, and people are getting excited about price momentum.

[10:44] Articles get circulated, all that sort of thing. More people come in, and it goes all the way up. And then seemingly invariably, the bubble bursts, and someone is fleeced at the top. And whether it's outright theft or merely collapsing asset values or some mix thereof, everyone's hurt on the other side.

[11:08] And then sort of the crypto is somehow this way of surviving all of this. The protocols themselves seem to be quite sound. But I guess the question is, do you guys remember Mt. Gox distinctly? I feel like everyone, lots of people I knew who were not quite crypto savvy in the industry, etcetera, were suddenly paying attention when it was happening.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:36] With the hot topic just getting into things. Yeah. I—what year was it? Was it 2015, 2014?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[11:44] 2014, probably. Right? I think Mt. Gox was '13. Let me check. Yeah. I think it was '13.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[11:52] Yeah. Okay. So that was a little before, but that was still the topic that everybody was talking about at the time. I was new enough to it that I was observing it as a third party. It was interesting to me. But yeah, I think I spent a little time to understand what, because the newspaper coverage, like usual, was terrible about it.

[12:18] They didn't explain what was going on. So I spent a little time to understand that, yes, there was a problem, but no, it had nothing to do with blockchain.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:30] I think you're right. So the run up was actually '13 into the '14, it looks like. Or okay. So it officially shuttered February. Though, and the big, the $1200 that I remember was like November 2013, it looks like.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[12:50] When did the hack happen? December. Oh, it happened. Right here. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Happened right there. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[12:59] So, yeah, interesting times for sure. Because I think Mt. Gox—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[13:04] And oh, what was I'm blanking right now. What was the name of that dark web marketplace that used—Silk Road. Silk Road. Yeah. Like, I think those were kind of intertwined in those early days. Right? So I remember even going on to Silk Road just to check what it was about, and I was kind of shocked with what I saw listed there. Lots of illicit stuff was listed there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[13:35] That's wow. I think I never did that. I think I never actually navigated to Silk Road. Just heard about it at length. I had an account, and some others. There's a period where they were doing crypto stuff, and then I think they stopped. And I believe they're still around as like a payment API company.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[13:59] Yeah. Because I remember them and some others. I remember the Silk Road arrests and the Mt. Gox hacks came relatively within the same time frame of each other, and that was like the sort of, as you mentioned, the first kind of iteration of, like, oh, crypto and blockchain is dead now, and then it just keeps coming back. Right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[14:24] Yeah. It sure does.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[14:26] Okay. There's a little bit of bias in the news on how they cover problems in crypto versus problems in the traditional world. Like, if there's fraud and it happens to happen on the blockchain, then that means that the blockchain is a corrupt place.

[14:44] And if there's fraud and it happens in traditional banking, that means that it might mean that we need a little more regulation or something, but that was a bad person. So it's always much more tied into, the price of Bitcoin can drop quite a bit when something like this happens.

[15:06] But you don't see stocks crashing because somebody commits fraud somewhere. I mean, I guess if the fraud's big enough.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[15:14] Yeah. Agreed. Just segueing quickly, can you guys go into how you met? Because you guys met first, and then we can do the whole how we all—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[15:26] Yeah. Jim, do I wanna start, or do you wanna start?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[15:29] I'll start, and I'll pass it over. I actually, so I had, back in the nineties, was in academia in the aughts. I was in the startup world, and I'd done a couple startups. And I was ending one of my startups, and I had two sons who were in our local school in California, which was a Mandarin immersion school.

[15:56] And at this time, there was just a coincidence that both my wife and I had ended jobs. And we said, hey, let's be crazy right now, and let's take this to its extension. Let's go to China and actually put them in a school there.

[16:16] So I called around some various friends, and one of the friends I called was a VC who had just funded a startup of Victor's in Beijing. And he says, I'm gonna get you in touch with these guys. So in fact, let me pass it over to you right now, and you can explain.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[16:36] Well yeah. And so the VC who we're still friends with, he kind of came up to me, and he explicitly said, oh, I have this brilliant CTO, and he says he wants to come to China. I'm not sure how serious he is. So you know what? Don't put all your eggs in this basket.

[16:57] But then we started talking that summer, and you weren't traveling in the country, so you were in a different place every couple of—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[17:05] The advantage of us both being jobless at the time is that we got in a car and started just driving around the country.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[17:12] And I remember we were kind of talking over the summer, and I was seeing how serious you were about coming. And at one point, you said, okay. Look. If you can get my kids into a Chinese school in Beijing, I will come and take the job to Beijing.

[17:33] And I went to the school that my kids went to and said, can you make space for two foreign kids in this international program? They said, yes, if you can, but the kids have to be here the first day of school. And first day of school was two weeks from that conversation.

[17:54] So I called Jim up and said, look. I can do it. I can guarantee a place for them, but you have to be here on this day. And to my shock, he actually said yes, and he packed up his house and turned off—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[18:10] Packed everything in the house in, I think we had twelve days to be in school, and we probably had to have the house back within less than a week. So yeah. That was a crazy week.

[18:26] But Victor was a great help. We were going to a country we'd never been to before, didn't know much about. Victor had also moved to Asia a few years earlier, and so he had sort of scoped out everything. And he knew where the good schools were. He knew where the good apartment buildings were, helped us out tremendously.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[18:48] So yeah. It was a great experience. It was an exciting time to be in China. It was right around the first Olympics. Like, it was right around the Beijing Olympics, and so it's a really exciting time. But yeah, you wound up staying for about eighteen months, right, in total?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[19:09] A little less, but yeah, it was over a year. Yeah. And then we just kept in touch from there. Like, we loved working together.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[19:18] Yeah. It was great. What year did you arrive? Or what was this rough time period? Yeah. Who were you asking? Because it was different for me. You, Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[19:30] Oh, 2011. 2011. Twenty eleven summer. We're driving all over the country. 2011, September, August. I can't remember. We were in Beijing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[19:45] Gotcha. Gotcha. Very cool. And so then you're back 2012 or early twenty thirteen, something like that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[19:53] Yeah. We were back, when did we come back? I guess we were back in the country in 2013. Gotcha. It's about, like, January.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[20:03] Gotcha. Let me, I'll segue. I'll try to keep it slightly chronological to keep everything in my mind here consistent. So I was in grad school at Berkeley between 2012 and really 2015. I got to start working on Ethereum kind of purely by accident.

[20:28] Maybe not purely by accident, but basically, I had passed my qualifying exam, I'm gonna say, 2014 or maybe May, April or May 2014. So for those who have not, not aware of how PhD program works, qualifying exam is one of the last things you need to do before you just do the research and produce the thesis.

[20:54] So sometimes there's a coursework requirement. Sometimes you need to translate a work from an academic work from one language to another to show proficiency. I think most of them have dropped those requirements at this point. And so it's a whole bunch of study, intense prep at Berkeley.

[21:18] It's a three hour oral exam with a couple people from your department and one from an external department, and then they give you a pass or not. I got a pass, thankfully. It was a, I don't know that it was, everyone feels bad after their qualifying exam except the people who are really good. Right?

[21:43] So while I passed it, it didn't feel great at least the rest of that day.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[21:50] But when do you find out the result? Like, is it— Immediately. Oh, you do? Okay. They put you in the hall, and they tell you. Yeah. Okay. That's good. So you're just very nervous for—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[22:02] I don't know what it was like for you, but for me, it was just like three guys I knew. And I was nervous too, but it wasn't like they had to go and calculate numbers or something. They just kinda come out, and they're like, yeah. Yeah.

[22:18] Exactly. No. It was like that. Right? Yeah. It's a oral. It's subjective in a sense, but you've got several of the world's foremost experts in some subjects. So they're able to assess whether you understand it enough or not to proceed with research.

[22:38] So, anyways, so I kind of, the qualifying exam led to, I needed a short break from math. I was in mathematical physics, and I had almost taken a job working for sort of a data science company that was taking, I can't quite remember.

[23:02] So something having to do with Nielsen TV ratings and doing something with the data and maybe selling it back to networks. I can't remember at this time. But it seemed like an okay thing. I also wanted to go back to New York for the summer. I'm from New York.

[23:24] And as with many New Yorkers, it took some time to adapt to the California culture, and I didn't fully do it. I still, I'm prone sometimes to bash the Bay Area, but I still kinda like it there.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[23:40] That's by the way. Yes. Yes. Jim's there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[23:44] I'm in the state of New York at the moment. But but yeah. But I needed a little break, basically. And it ended up being possible to work on the Ethereum project. So somehow, I guess I'll go into this somehow. My dad, Joe, got attached to the project basically because he was always tracking Bitcoin and blockchain for a long time.

[24:14] He had a CS background plus the financial background and ran a hedge fund for a number of years. And so it's just kind of always watching technological innovations in financial services. And I guess always had a little bit of the blockchain philosophical character, in that, let's say, pro-freedom, little bit of a libertarian streak kinda thing.

[24:42] And I believe he happened to just be visiting our family. So he's from Toronto. A lot of blockchain people in Toronto for one reason or another. And he went, I believe, to it might have been a Bitcoin meetup at that time, or it might have been the first Ethereum meetup.

[25:04] But this would have been January, February 2014, I believe. And Vitalik was speaking there. And like everyone around that time where you see Vitalik speak about something, you got really excited. Right? And so he actually got ready to start helping out the project right away.

[25:28] He actually thought for a time that he might be a software developer for the project and it didn't turn out that way. We can go into it a little bit later. But he started working on it again, let's say, February, March, 2014. And so he just sent me the white paper, like, right after or maybe right before my qualifying exam.

[25:53] I got a chance to read it, and it was pretty cool and interesting and new. And that was sort of the first time I grasped the potential of technology, and it caused me to go back and read the Bitcoin white paper, etcetera. And it was sort of exciting enough to work on for that summer, basically. So that's how I got into it.

[26:17] And subsequently, Jim alluded to this earlier, I started to work with the project and reached out to Steve Hsu, a great friend of ours. Kind of, not quite famously brilliant. Definitely brilliant, somewhat famous. Super cool guy, and I'd been a longtime reader of Steve's blog.

[26:41] He's one of the few really excellent kind of general communicators who's a super technical guy, but most people who are really technical in communication have a hard time distilling it for at least kind of a mass market audience, but Steve is actually good at that, but with nuanced coverage of technical topics.

[27:04] So, anyway, caught up with Steve, and that takes us to Steve forwarding on the Ethereum white paper to Jim. And I believe the first time I spoke to Steve, I was in New York, but was just about to go back to the Bay Area. So that takes us to maybe January or sorry, June, July 2014.

[27:30] And maybe I came back in August or something like that. And it turned out that Jim was there in Hayward, and we got to meet up. I wonder if you did anything. August 2014, September, something like that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[27:48] Oh, it was around then because, also, ironically, I was driving across the country that summer too, and it was right after I came back. That's weird. Your big life changes are related to some cross country trip. You do a—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[28:04] Obviously. Soul searching. You do a literal search.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[28:08] Yeah. Cross country. Well—See, I was in Montana, and then I was back in the Bay Area, and then we talked.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[28:17] Yeah. Okay. That's how was Montana, by the way? It did wow. Maybe we shouldn't go to yeah. Montana, oddly crypto friendly.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[28:26] Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Big Sky Country. Right? Yeah. Big Sky Country.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[28:31] Okay. So let me see here. I want to, I have a couple other 2014 anecdotes that you guys may not even know that much about, but maybe we should jump ahead to 2015 and go back. So—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[28:48] Just before we go past 2014. So I moved back from China in 2014. And so me and Jim were talking about, like, oh, now that I was back, what kind of project could we do together? So while you had started that conversation, me and Jim were thinking about, okay, maybe we could work on a startup together.

[29:12] And at some point, you forwarded me the paper as well. So that's kind of how I got into it as well.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[29:20] I wanna give yeah. I don't wanna speak the whole time, but but I have some info here that I forget if I told you guys at length. Okay. Go for it. In 2014, so basically, I did work on the Ethereum project through a bunch of 2014.

[29:42] As far as tech projects go, it was much more global, little more European, but you had Canada. You got a bunch of people in Zug, Switzerland, a little bit in Israel in the early days. We worked out of an office. My dad and I and a guy named Steven who is now kinda famous.

[30:09] Actually, if you Google the name, it's definitely an interesting and colorful story, that I'll go into a little bit. And a guy named Jonathan, whose last name I couldn't find when I was writing this down, but Jonathan's a good guy. And I don't know if they kind of parted ways at some point or how that all happened.

[30:33] So we're working in this office in Times Square and really trying to find kind of different ways to advance the project, meeting with lots of people. So that's when I met Steve who introduced me to Jim, basically, just kind of calling up whoever might be interested.

[30:54] But part of the plans that the Ethereum folks had was, they acknowledged that there would be a need for kinda ongoing pure research and then in addition to more focused R&D to build the network out. And so Vitalik, at some point, penned an article about 10 hard problems in cryptocurrency or something of that nature.

[31:21] And I think it was, if we went back now, it would look both very insightful and a little bit dated. I'm sure some of them have been solved, and some of them may not need to be solved because something else emerged. But basically, he foresaw the need for privacy above and beyond pseudonymity, for instance. Yeah. Or and many things of that.

[31:49] Transition from proof of work to proof of stake or just like energy efficient blockchains, which people were talking about at that time. But my position in academia at that time seemed to be helpful as the blockchain people were just so different from the academia people despite being both of them being really smart groups of people.

[32:16] Blockchain people were not worried about doing things through the proper channels and approval and writing it up the right way and all that sort of thing. Whereas something about academia makes you fearful of being wrong, because you're wrong enough in public. There are kind of consequences for it.

[32:39] And the kind of I would say the tech attitude in general is like getting something out there. Get it to work, basically, but get it out and then iterate. And blockchain people had that in an extreme. And I would say, also, Ethereum was much more like that than the Bitcoin culture.

[33:03] The Bitcoin culture was like a bunch of practicing but academic cryptographers who never wanted to change anything. And the Ethereum people were more like have the software and computer science engineering attitude of, well, let's get out there. Let's tinker with it. Let's kinda see what happens.

[33:25] And there's good arguments for both, especially when we're talking about a system that custodies, well, not custodies, but records a lot of high value ownership interests and allows them to be transferred. But all that is to say, it was useful for the Ethereum Foundation to have sort of someone who's actively in academia to kinda work with and coordinate everything.

[33:52] So we agreed to work on a body called the cryptocurrency research group, and that was composed of sort of myself, Vitalik, and our friend Aaron Wright. He's a, since going on to a number of web three projects, but at the time was a practicing attorney, but also a professor at Cardozo Law School.

[34:18] And he came to that Times Square office, which was not the greatest of offices, I would say, and just sorta really leaned in on Ethereum and kinda helped structure everything so that it would be kind of the most robust, not just technology, but they actually did kind of a quite good job in figuring out how to set things up that other projects since did, certainly did not do as good a job, I'll say.

[34:50] So it was funny times. And in 2014, I also got to go to Zug. For those who don't know, the Ethereum Foundation was one of the first to head to be headquartered in Switzerland, and it was kind of, it's become a very popular choice for crypto foundations, because I guess the Ethereum Foundation sort of blazed a path.

[35:18] And okay. Funny thing about Switzerland is that the kind of local authorities also just seem like business people. Like, they wanna land the future tax revenue and employment. And so you can kind of, once Switzerland is split into some number of Cantons, which are like states, well, a little smaller than US states, of course.

[35:42] And so you can kind of go from Canton to Canton and try to get the best offer. And offer really means tax treatment, any kind of grants, or just like helping get fast answers around legal questions. One of the tough things with The United States is that sometimes you don't know what's allowed.

[36:07] And the Swiss environment, they were fairly clear about what they wanted for the special tax treatment and etcetera, etcetera. So we went out and visited Zug, I don't know, mid late summer twenty fourteen, and I got to meet all of the founders of Ethereum at that time. I believe there are kind of eight in total. And yeah. So I think—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[36:35] Those numbers changed over time, though. Yeah. Those numbers changed.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[36:40] Yes. So well but but yeah. I think so, I don't exactly know how all of it happened, but Vitalik, there's always a global project. Right? So Vitalik would kinda go around the world and evangelize, get people excited, and they would wanna work with the project.

[37:00] And so a bunch of folks got attached to it. And I think, obviously, it worked. Right? But if he were to do it again, I bet he would be a little bit more careful about adding folks to it because eight is just too many. Like, if you went to a US venture capitalist with a slide that says eight cofounders, and they're not all currently running billion dollar companies, you'd be just laughed out of the room.

[37:29] And yet it worked. Right? It actually functioned. And the, so kind of the way it broke apart was that there were the technical element, technical guys. So I think, I don't quite know how this happened, but pretty early on, like, Gavin Wood, Jeff Wilcke started building out versions of Ethereum, the C++ and Go clients.

[37:58] Specifically, we're going to the clients soon because there's good stories there. Vitalik was building the Python client. They were all working together on technical documentation. And the reason that people were building multiple clients was that there was the perception that Bitcoin was controlled and centralized because there's only really one definitive client, Bitcoin-D. Right?

[38:26] And so there was this kinda huge replication of technical effort. Like, each of them eventually got their own teams. There were JavaScript clients. There's many of them kinda came out later. And I'd say the project, so the project had sort of tech folks and business folks, like like any tech project.

[38:50] Didn't really have a nominal CEO at at any time. It was closest to being Charles Hoskinson. So I think at the time I went to Zug, the leadership looked like on the business side, Charles is the CEO. Amir, who is in Israel, he kinda did business development. He's a funny guy. I still see him every once in a while.

[39:20] Joe, my dad, and Anthony Di Iorio as the other business guys who probably had the most operating experience. And then the tech side was Vitalik, Jeff, Gavin, and then Mihai had sort of done corporate setup. I believe Mihai worked with Vitalik on Bitcoin Magazine.

[39:44] So Vitalik, very interesting character where most of the time, your technical geniuses are not good communicators, and he was sort of a journalist running Bitcoin magazine, running a lot of the articles. I don't know if he started it or kind of joined it. And he would, I think he kinda crowdfunded the articles a little bit.

[40:11] Like, for, if I can get a pledge of 1 Bitcoin, I'll write an article about x. And at the time, Bitcoin was inexpensive, but those values went up, and I think it actually ended up being a good funding mechanism, the articles he wrote in the future.

[40:32] And it led him to kind of have a sort of impartial thought leader position in addition to his really strong technical ability and the ideas he was generating, etcetera. And I know he had joined a bunch of projects early on and helped work with them. Like, I think Mastercoin was maybe the first colored coin project. He did some work on that.

[40:57] So, anyway, so those were the eight at the time. And there was a meeting for everyone to kinda get on the same page. Remote project, there was a Slack. People were maybe working a little bit at cross purposes, lots of infighting. People are stressed. They're trying to deliver on this awesome concept that Vitalik put out there.

[41:23] And then everyone kinda tried to grab ownership of. Like, was there a reason to have all these different clients? In the end, empirically, it worked. Right? But a little bit of it was a want, Ethereum to be mine sort of thing. And I saw this in the room when we're visiting there.

[41:47] So basically, on this trip, everyone went outside at some point, and people were kind of a little bit sick. The tech people were sick of what the business people were doing to some extent. There's always this tension. It's not probably especially early in a company where the tech people are like, what do I need you business guy for? Like, we're gonna make this thing, and it's gonna get out there.

[42:15] And the business people have to go raise the money, find sales, find partnerships, etcetera. And it's subjective stuff that the tech people don't like or sometimes understand. And more or less, this happened. People are uncomfortable with kind of promises that Charles was making, and just the accusations. I don't really even know what was going on at that time.

[42:42] But there was this general sense of frustration with him. He also, he seems to be, in some ways, executing well on like an effective smart business strategy, but maybe over promising what's possible to the point of breaking people out. I know we kinda seen later, I think some of the stuff with Cardano was probably at least aggressive, I would say.

[43:10] But that, the jury was not out at that time in my eyes. Right? And Amir also was in Target because I think people just thought he wasn't doing enough, it sounded like. And so they were both jettisoned from the project in Zug. And I was like, they were out on the terrace. It's like and they had a nice sort of loft that they rented that was the Ethereum dev house in Zug.

[43:40] And so I'm watching this happen and it was kind of quite crazy. And then, actually, they instated two more cofounders, so to speak, right then, who kinda jumped on board the project and helped out. It was a, it was like a fun and kind of crazy trip otherwise.

[44:03] We went out in Zurich. Some people got in trouble with the cops. I won't add more detail to that. But, Zurich's a funny place where in The US, we're not used to people drinking on the street. And in Zurich, everyone drinks on the street, and few people are in the bars. It was a strange experience.

[44:27] We went on some hikes. It's a very nice part of the world, Switzerland. But plenty of drama in the early days. I remember having a funny conversation with Gavin about, he had this book about swarm behavior, and he learned I had a mathematical background as we're talking about the mathematics of swarms and all that sort of thing.

[44:53] But yeah, the the it felt nascent, intense, but disorganized. They were also grappling with the decision on initially, they wanted to have a nonprofit protocol and a for profit. They called it crypto Google at the time to sort of monetize the nonprofit protocol.

[45:17] And plenty of blockchain companies have gone and done that sort of thing subsequently. But that was also decided at that meeting that they would be all not for profit. Yeah. And people didn't like it. Some folks started talking about brain drain. It was a mix. Some people liked it. Some some didn't.

[45:38] Sort of the threat being, like, you don't do this for profit, like, I'm gonna leave this project kinda thing. And I think about everyone sort of went off and did start their own businesses. So it is what it is. But, anyways, let me let me pause and see if, did I tell this whole story to you guys at any point?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[46:02] I think you told parts of it and not the entire thing. But, yes, I didn't realize the sort of Game of Thrones aspect happened in all of that period short period of time. I knew that all that had happened behind the scenes. And I think it was this all, I think it was going on continually,

**SPEAKER_00:**
[46:24] but it came to a head all in this one meeting. Sort of a funny memory. So Bitcoin Suisse was getting off the ground at that time, and we met with a guy named Niklas, I believe, who maybe was the CEO or one of the founders. I just googled it. It says founder, and there's a different CEO now.

[46:46] But he made this funny. He's a nice guy, and I think something happened there. I'm not quite sure. He made this funny comment. We were in an elevator, and it shows the difference between the American and Swiss attitude. We're in an elevator, and it was one of the ones where it's kinda hand operated and you do it yourself.

[47:09] And it's just like the door could just easily close on you. And I was like, wow. Like, we'd never have this in The US because we're so litigious. And they said, well, yeah, Swiss attitude natural selection. Yeah. So anyways.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[47:27] I know. Sometimes I think things get grandfathered in. Like, some of those subway platforms in New York are pretty terrifying too.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[47:35] They are. Certainly. Yeah. It could just be that it's older there. Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[47:40] That makes sense.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[47:42] But yeah. So I think the big other than some Zug, basically, what we saw or let me see. There was growing momentum around the project. Lots of people all over the world kinda working on it. Stuff was probably not tightly papered. There's no employment agreements probably at that time. It was like but there was really intense excitement.

[48:09] And I think the belief that everyone was gonna be mega successful out of it, like, one way or another. It's been kind of interesting to watch. Then, Jim, do you wanna talk about getting into it? And I alluded to all the different clients of Ethereum and the reason why there was more than one. Do you wanna tell your report of that part now?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[48:35] Well, this part of the story, when you were doing all that stuff, I was too busy driving around the country, But I came back— But it comes in a little later, like, three months later, right, or or rest of the year. Yeah. Right at the end of the summer, right when you were coming back, I think.

[48:53] So and that's when when I got really interested in it. I remember the whole culture so I got, I got fascinated with the technology when I read the white paper. That's when I realized this was something something big. And I wanted to immerse myself into the world a little bit, but it was a foreign culture to me.

[49:18] Like, we decided, to, so Natasha, my wife and I, we decided just to see what what this world was like. We'd buy, try buying a little Bitcoin. And, I remember, we sort of we looked a little bit at the various ways to do it, and the way we decided on was to meet someone in a coffee shop in the middle of Berkeley.

[49:45] And we got there, and he was totally the stereotype. The dude was walking around with the five toed shoes, and, we kinda like it all felt very salacious. We walked in with this packet of money in our hands, and we had to meet this guy. And he spent most of the time— Do you remember did he use Local Bitcoins that was popular?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[50:13] I don't know if it's still in existence. Local Bitcoins. Okay. Gotcha. Sorry. Go ahead, Jim.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[50:20] Yeah. He spent most of the time there railing against the government, how much he hated the US government and all the things they, all the terrible things they were doing. We kinda transferred the envelope over him, and then we pulled up a computer or or phones or something, and we were watching for six blocks to come by.

[50:47] And finally, it went through, and we were finally Bitcoin owners. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[50:52] Wait. Did you hang out with him for an hour? Or did he then—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[50:56] because I think we did wait for the six blocks. I was gonna say— We may have been maybe after three, he said to us, like, you're welcome to stay here if you want, but I find that after three, it probably won't revert or something. So maybe we— oh, I remember what it was.

[51:13] We went out and sat in the car for another thirty minutes just in case we had to run back in again. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[51:19] That's really funny.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[51:21] Yeah. Oh, man. But yeah. So I, that was our introduction into Bitcoin. And then around this time, you and I started hanging out a lot. We were meeting regularly, and I was working, I had started working on the Haskell client, and I brought you in on that. And we were, we'd have these coding sessions at your place.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[51:47] Yeah, man. Okay. So we've gone to so that's fall twenty fourteen, right, when we started coding or or even, like—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[51:57] yeah. Yeah. Fall twenty fourteen. Yeah. And I'm, I was sort of laughing when you're talking about the overpromising. Like, I was immediately fascinated by Ethereum, but I also remember trying to understand what it was at the beginning.

[52:18] And some of some of the material out there was great, but some of it was just very vague and and overbroad. Like, I would go to these YouTube videos, and people would be like, Ethereum is a new way of life. It's gonna take over as a second Internet, and we are gonna rebuild the Internet from beginning to end. And I was like, what are they talking about?

[52:42] And so the only way I was gonna really understand this stuff, I thought, was to literally just start writing code. And so, you can't hide what's happening. Once you have, so the I talked about the white paper, but but Gavin Wood had put up a yellow paper at the same time, which talked about the technical details of the innards.

[53:08] And so I started looking through that and implementing that in in my favorite language, Haskell. And bit by bit, putting the whole EVM in Haskell code. So and that's what most of the end of the of the year was like until, I think, in December, I was, so I'm from, I'm from the East Coast myself.

[53:37] And we flew, sorry. We flew out to New York, and, and I met you introduced me, I, you were there at the time too. You you introduced me to Joe. And, actually, I think before that too, you had set up phone calls where I talked to Vitalik and Joe directly too.

[54:02] So, and just more and more with the, the fact that we had a working client, that we were sort of following very closely all the changes in in the test net era before before things were solidified. We just got pulled more and more into to that world. And I think, like, one of the big things that— sorry.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[54:28] I was just gonna keep, we've been sort of assuming an expert audience. Can you define the term client for everybody?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[54:37] Oh, so, it's the software that blockchain runs on. The thing about usual software is, that, like, if I just, like, gonna run a video game or something, I just get a computer and I put the software on it, and that's that's my running project.

[54:55] In a blockchain, it's blockchain is a distributed thing. So you have to create a piece of software that can be run from anywhere in the world on any on multiple computers simultaneously. So you're building sort of a world computer of chained nodes, they call them.

[55:18] And so, we were building one of these nodes that could connect to the existing test, for net, test net at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[55:27] Yeah. Gotcha. Perfect. Putting us in the client arms race, if you will. That was the— Yeah. One I was I was trying to make. Yeah. I wanna talk real quickly about some other things from that summer. You guys participated in the crowdsale, did you not? That that's why you bought the Bitcoin the first time, or did you buy it sort of first?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[55:50] Yeah. Got a token amount.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[55:52] Yeah. Gotcha. So from our side, we ended up mostly my dad, but obviously with help from the Ethereum people. So they coded up a site to do the crowdsale. So Ethereum was one of the first, maybe the first, to pioneer, basically, a kind of prefunding event, if you will, where they sold the token ether in exchange for Bitcoin to the users of—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[56:23] Basically an ICO. Right? Like, what would—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[56:26] It was essentially an ICO. There was no name for it then. Yeah. But the, I remember it was the price varied a little bit over the course of the sale, but it was like 1 Bitcoin to 2,000 ether, which, meant, you made pretty good returns if you participated in the crowdsale and sold at the right time or still holding.

[56:53] So but the way it worked, it was complicated. So Ethereum itself made ICOs pretty easy. The for Bitcoin, it was basically, I think the Ethereum Foundation had to set up an address for you to send the Bitcoin to and so that they could mint the ether in the genesis block for you.

[57:20] And you also, but the the the foundation, like, rightfully in decentralization terms, did not want to just hold everybody's keys. Right? So you had to sort of generate your own keys, and the website did this and download them. And there's these huge warnings like, you must download this file. If you lose this file, you will lose access to your funds.

[57:48] And so some of the the Ethereum folks coded it up, and there was some, they had to, I think they generated unique addresses for each funding event for for traceability sake. I'm not quite sure if they did that. Maybe there was just one exodus address or all that sort of thing. But, actually, no, there must have been just one.

[58:13] So we were a little bit the help desk. So sometimes people would try to, it wouldn't work, try to try to purchase Ether. And there were interesting goings on. There was a fake Twitter account that emerged with the e and the u in Ethereum transposed. So it looked just like Ethereum, and they had assembled 25,000 followers or something.

[58:42] No doubt bots that whatever hacker controlled or maybe you pay for those. And they were offering special deals on ether. So it went live. So this is something that's been going on for ten years now. I, even I've heard new crypto projects, when they start to get popular, people start selling their tokens over Twitter even before those tokens are issued now, so they've gotten more sophisticated.

[59:11] But yeah. So I remember reaching out to a friend of mine who was working at Twitter at the time and helping escalate the ticket that, because the, like, a big theft could occur, and I believe did not. Jonathan configured one of the block explorers. Maybe it was blockchain.info. I can't remember.

[59:37] So that every time money hit a certain address, a noise would play. So we're in this room, and and we were, we're in the room all day because it's like we're in help desk mode. And we just hear the things come in, and then there was a schedule over fourteen days you could fund at no monetary consequence, and then the price started to go up over the course of, I believe, a forty two day sale.

[60:07] So all in all, I think 7,000 unique purchasers, something like that. But it was, like, it was quite an affair. Right? It it's definitely more streamlined now. And to clear the way to do all of this, they got a legal opinion, that they're selling software in essence to people from a reputable law firm and some of that all that made it to the terms and conditions.

[60:38] So it's a big rush to get it all done. And then so I think that raised, you didn't even remember. It was like $22,000,000—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[60:47] at the time. Yeah. I thought it well, it was in Bitcoin, so I think it was, like, in 20 mil— well, I remember vaguely that it was—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[60:56] At the time of the sale, it was 22,000,000. Yeah. I think it was the biggest crowdfunding—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[61:01] event ever or something like that. I believe that's right. It's either one or two ever at that time, and it's since been surpassed by tons,—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[61:10] many of which—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[61:11] Many were done on Ethereum. Coin that comes out. Yeah. Exactly. But, yeah, but, like, I think at the time, it was around or over 20,000,000. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[61:22] Yeah. That's that's right. And, interestingly, in the course of the sale and maybe a little bit having to do with the sale, the price of Bitcoin starts to go down. So I believe it's $600 or so at the start of the sale, and it's just it's kind of we noticed it dropping kind of continually, I guess.

[61:44] And maybe by the end of it, it's high fours, low fives, and it's foreshadowing. It'll kinda go on to drop from there. But yeah. Okay. So did you guys, remember the experience of the the the funding site and all that sort of thing? I think we were not speaking about that specific detail at that time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[62:08] I remember the site. I remember a clock on it, but, I don't remember too much else about it. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[62:15] Okay. So the crowdsale is not a huge part of your memory. It's a huge part of mine, I guess, because we were dealing with all of the issues. But, Vic, were you, you were just getting kinda interested at this time. Right? Like—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[62:30] Well, yeah. Exactly. Like, well, Jim, like, Jim, basically, when he was going to buy this Bitcoin, he was like, oh, I'm gonna buy this Bitcoin to participate in the crowdsale. Do you wanna participate? And I was like, I'm gonna feel like a real idiot if I don't do anything.

[62:51] So I just, it was just some, yeah. We were just gonna say, like, oh, it's some nominal amount that we did. And, of course, it's probably turned into the best investment I ever made. But, like, yeah, it was, we had pulled our resources together because it was so hard.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[63:10] It wasn't easy. Right? You're like, generating this, 12 word seed phrases, this, that, the other. It just was mind bogglingly complicated, so—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[63:21] and but, like, I think the biggest problem with the step was getting actual Bitcoin. Like, I mean, Jim was in the Bay Area, right, the heart of IT and all the tech things. I was in Vancouver and it wasn't, Vancouver was an early Bitcoin adopter, but it was still really, really hard to find anyone who would be willing to sell you Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[63:47] Yeah. Yeah. That's very interesting. Yes. In any case, the okay. So the sale happens, and now the project is funded, and it's really funded. I suppose there are plenty of mega VC investments at that time, but it's, the bubble years in 2020, 2021 were not heard of at this time.

[64:16] Like, series A investments were still between March. Salaries probably a little lower than they are now back then. This was a lot of money. And so the Ethereum folks then kind of, it was very technically driven. They kicked in all of their technical dreams, so to speak.

[64:39] So to Jim's point about the really big claims, they really were, in a sense, trying to create a whole new Internet. A couple examples. So not just the proliferation of clients. Right? They're gonna make a browser, the Mist browser. They're gonna make a peer to peer messaging system called Whisper.

[65:03] They're gonna make a decentralized file storage system. They made, they chose to make a virtual machine like Java. And, we always thought that JavaScript was the better analogy because it kinda won on the Internet. Has anyone ever seen an applet in the last fifteen, twenty years?

[65:28] But they made multiple languages that would compile to the EVM. And there's some benefit to that. It could definitely evolve over time. I don't know. Did you have a more specific memory of, like, they were making a lot of stuff. It was, can you get into the experience of trying to make something compatible with what they were doing at that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[65:54] Well, once I found the yellow paper, it wasn't as difficult because that centered me around the blockchain part of it. But it was that earlier marketing material that was very confusing to me because they would talk about, you would definitely see these videos like, what is Ethereum?

[66:14] And then it would just go off onto all these things like you mentioned, a browser or a messaging system. And I think there was even some talk in there about replacing TCP/IP or something. I can't remember. Some of these things actually came into being. Some of these didn't.

[66:34] And so I think my learning process was first realizing what blockchain was, but then digging a little deeper and being confused that I didn't really know what was happening because I thought this was gonna be a blockchain project, and then they were talking about writing browsers.

[66:53] And then and then realizing when I saw the yellow paper that, yeah, this is the core of what Ethereum is. That other stuff is sort of like pipe dream stuff that may or may not come to being, but but yeah. So that's how it went. And then then once I got into the concrete test net work, that then I understood what was going on. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[67:17] Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. It was it was wild. So and I'm I'm struggling to remember the timing on all of this. Actually, no. I'll go to, I'll go to kind of to Cryptoeconomicon first. And then so now we're going into January or so 2015.

[67:40] So a couple times, so Vitalik visits the Bay Area a bunch. Did you remember, we went to a couple meetups with Vitalik. Did we not?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[67:51] Yeah. He was, I think he was super casual. I remember it's it's funny because, like, now now he's famous. But but in those days, we would just sort of hang out with him after the meetings, and and he would kinda go and bum a couch to sleep on in the night.

[68:13] One time we drove him to somebody that he found a couch to sleep on. Just fun casual times.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[68:21] Yeah. Yeah. There was, I think he, so he won the Thiel Fellowship, so there were beds there. And I have a memory of, I think we drove, well, there was a meet up in the South Bay and you drove him into the city or something like that.

[68:41] There was a crypto castle in SF at that time that we occasionally visited, and he could hang out there. It was, I imagine he still, really has little need for creature comforts. I'm sure he could procure whatever he likes. But, it was funny times for sure.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[69:07] Some really nice couches nowadays. Really nice couches these days.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[69:12] Yeah. But so I can't even remember quite how we got the idea, but we were talking about, for whatever reason, a bunch of people were going to be in the Bay Area late January twenty fifteen. And we decided to, and I had also, so through Steve, through Ben Lorica, who's a great guy, who is at the time sort of the, I think he's head of data science, but also really the head kinda head of content for O'Reilly's conferences and that sort of thing.

[69:49] We booked a conference at Fort Mason, and I had a cohost named Lauren Lapine, also running a crypto startup these days, I believe. Also a great guy. And we, so given that the conference was on the calendar and we knew a bunch of people in part for the conference, but I think something else was going on too would be in the Bay Area at that time, we decided to run kind of a parallel technical conference that week, which we named the verbose Cryptoeconomicon.

[70:29] I think the term cryptoeconomics either was invented or popularized by Vitalik. There's also this guy named Vlad Zamfir. I don't know quite how to pronounce his last name. He was working a lot with Vitalik on proof of stake and other things and went on to start his own, I think, fairly successful crypto project, the name of which is currently escaping me.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[70:55] Well, he worked on proof of stake for a long time. Right? Like, then he—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[71:00] He did. Have Casper proof of stake. But I think he, yeah, I think he did it for the foundation for a while, but then started his own thing sometime later. Funny guy. But he would say, like, cryptoeconomics. Is it crypto, or is it economics? And it sort of never really stuck, but that was the theme of the conference.

[71:24] So we had two academic track days and a business track day, I believe. And we had a bunch of speakers, one of whom, so we spoke at the O'Reilly meeting and then would also speak at Cryptoeconomicon. The building we did it in, so we were, it was cohosted with a company called Coinify, which I don't believe exists anymore.

[71:51] I had a nice guy named Tom Ding. But I guess Tom Ding had some good plug ins for capital and access with the Chinese government. Like, the bill, Vic, do you remember the details around who owned that building?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[72:10] I think it was some construction conglomerate. I remember— Yeah. Talking to him going like, what? Like, what does this have to do with construction? It didn't have anything to do with tech at all. Like, it was just— Yeah. That's the that's the thing I remember most about it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[72:27] So—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[72:28] Yes. So in this, I just wanna say I should point out that you guys met each other at this conference too.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[72:35] Well, no. We we met each other in, we'd already been having conversations online, I think, because you guys would get together and we'd chat sometimes, but we'd never actually met each other in person until that conference.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[72:51] Yeah. It was a month or two or three in, I think, at that time. Yeah. And it it was like it was a cast of characters. Like, the O'Reilly conference is a little more shiny corporate. Yeah. About three, four hundred attendees, something like that. Pretty pretty successful.

[73:13] The the Cryptoeconomicon conference was great, but kinda crazy. Like, there was a guy whose name is escaping me in these smart guy, very tight bike shorts, and he kept raising his hand and, I think he had a defense background. IBM had a big speaking slot.

[73:38] At the time, they were promoting Ethereum plus some other technologies as the key to their IoT stack. I'm—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[73:48] trying to even remember who all— Okay. I actually looked this up. So the participants, it was a very small group of people, like, I think twenty, twenty five. But in among that group of people was, so, yeah, Vlad who did proof of stake was there. Vitalik was there. Gavin was there who was working on Ethereum but later went on to do Polkadot.

[74:18] Dominic who went to do Internet Computer was there. Yeah. I think Jae Kwon. Jae Kwon was there. Went off to do Cosmos. Like, a bunch of Bitcoin core devs were there. It was just a crazy group of people to be like. I don't like, if you looked at the amount of talent, like, I know people are talking about the PayPal mafia.

[74:46] That was like the crypto mafia. Right? Like, it was like everyone who went off, almost everyone in that room went off to do a pretty successful project. And but they were like, I remember being in that room and kind of like, we'd started talking, and I was really starting on my journey about learning about Ethereum, and I was just completely baffled.

[75:12] Like, I spent probably 90% of my time on Wikipedia trying to figure out, like, what does the Byzantine generals problem have to do with technology? Why are they talking about this? Or snarks. What are snarks? Like, I remember looking like, to madly keep up with these things, but it was just being in that room was exciting.

[75:38] Like, you could, it was the first time that I ever totally clicked in that what they were trying to do was a new kind of computing platform. And that, because it always got overshadowed by the financial money crypto aspect of it, right? But you could in that room, it was very different.

[76:02] It was just like everyone was really focused on like, okay, how do we build this world computer, right? So like and, yeah, like, I mean, the talent level was off the chart in that room. Like, it's just amazing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[76:17] Yeah. Vic should tell the Robin Hanson story. So for for the for context of the listener, if we forget any, Robin Hanson is a really smart guy, kind of famous sort of quite technical economist. I think it's George Mason or something like that. Good Twitter follow too. You should you should follow him.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[76:41] Well, he he invented prediction markets, basically. He, yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. He's the father of prediction markets. So, and to be clear, Robin Hanson is way smarter than I'll ever be. But, so I was in that conference madly in Wikipedia for the three days ahead of O'Reilly. He was—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[77:05] We ourselves were all pretty new to blockchain. So yeah. We—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[77:09] That's true. But, like and, like, it was and people were going really, really deep into these conceptual things. And like so but after those three days was the O'Reilly conference. And at one point in the O'Reilly conference, they had sort of a lunch where everyone sat around these big tables and kind of a networking part of it.

[77:35] And I remember Robin was like one of the panelists on some panel about blockchain. And he was asking me like, oh, what do I do and what was I here for? And we had a conversation, and I just kind of summarized a few things that I'd learned over the past three days.

[77:57] And so we had this conversation, and I said, it's not really about money. It's about building this world computer and all these things. And he basically got on stage and reiterated a bunch of things I told him during lunch. And everyone was like, how did Robin become a blockchain expert? Like, he's really on the cutting edge of where this technology is. But it it was just amazing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[78:26] Yes. Yeah. It was quite a room of people. We had some other, we had, so Robin's also a bit of a futurist. We had another kind of futurist guy named Steve Omohundro. I don't know how to pronounce it. He's a super smart guy, as well, and I've not really spoken to him in long time.

[78:48] But it was, I think there was this an energy in the air that was quite palpable. And so it kind of, I don't know. Did this, it was a big thing that convinced us to start our company, I would say. And maybe not yeah. I think the thing that kind of convinced us was,—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[79:10] like, it was like being in two rooms. Right? There was Cryptoeconomicon where it was like everyone was talking about this new kind of computing platform and all the things it could do. And then there were the O'Reilly conference where you had a bunch of big bankers, Reid Hoffman was there and people, and they were talking about money.

[79:32] Like, this was about money. And and it was clear that they didn't know what was really going on in the other room. Like, that something much, much bigger was happening. And I think that convinced us as, oh, we could build a bridge between these two worlds.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[79:51] Yeah. Yeah. I remember that distinctly. And it was yeah. This is funny time. The big headliners at the O'Reilly conference, Reid Hoffman—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[80:01] Think spoke. Yeah. Yeah. Something like that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[80:04] Bill Janeway, I believe, and some others. Okay. I wanna shift gears to the client race, which we've hit on. But at this point, I got really into it. So I was never, I was, I learned in school enough how to program software, but was not a professional quality software developer, and I kind of learned enough of that quickly on the job with Jim.

[80:36] So as Jim alluded to, we would meet up at my Berkeley apartment. I think first, we were meeting at one on, I'm gonna say, Telegraph just north of Ashby.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[80:49] Yeah. Just on the right by the Oakland border.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[80:52] And then later, we met at a different one. Right? Campus.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[80:56] Very close to campus. Yeah. Like Bancroft and Telegraph.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[80:59] And, so it was an open source project. And there was because lots of people were making their own versions of it, there was sort of a, like I said, a fight for the definition of it, which is in the end settled by the yellow paper. But, can you talk a little bit about that time where we're just coding really hard, you and I, and just trying to keep pace with the spec, etcetera?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[81:30] Well, yeah. I mean, the it was fun and frustrating at the same time because, I think that the Ethereum Foundation was trying pretty hard to put the specs out there, but still things were changing faster than the yellow paper could could keep up to things.

[81:48] So I would just have something to the point where it was connecting and communicating and running the virtual machine. And then next day, I'd come in and completely wouldn't work. And maybe maybe a few weeks later, the the yellow paper would be updated to explain why.

[82:11] But in the meantime, the only way that I could sort of figure stuff out was to just go and get one of the other clients and read how in the world are they getting this thing to work. And then there was one point when they added encryption to the connection that essentially changed the protocol completely.

[82:33] I connected, wasn't working anymore. I had to just dig in and yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[82:39] That was— Actually, you you had just repressed that memory. The so mostly, Jim figured all of this out, but they, so the Ethereum people put, just for the technical audience, kind of the equivalent of something like SSL into the product. So they put end to end encryption in, and this is a complex handshake, and then a session was created between peers and yada yada.

[83:10] And so it's really hard to implement stuff like that because all of the messages you're getting back is encrypted. So you have to get it totally perfect, and then it makes sense. But if you don't get it perfect, nothing makes sense, and you don't know why.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[83:28] I was just irrationally angry about it. Like, I was like, I didn't care whether this was good or or bad for the for the product. I was like, why? But I was actually genuinely confused too because you have this open network that anyone can connect to, but you wanna encrypt everything that's going on it.

[83:51] It took me a while to figure out why that actually happened. I was asking around in various DM services. I don't remember where where I used to go and talk to people.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[84:03] I found— There were the giant Skype threads, I remember at the time. Oh, lord. There was huge, we this was, we weren't even using Slack yet. It was, there was tons of Skype.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[84:16] Slack was just getting popular at this time. Ethereum had a Slack. ConsenSys had a Slack. We can get into the ConsenSys story a little bit. And the but, yeah, we had a Skype thread for some reason, just because it was the thing that people used for a threaded discussion group. I think WhatsApp maybe wasn't popular or—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[84:39] Yeah. Not for this purpose.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[84:41] So—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[84:42] we spent a month— It's dug around a while. I dug around a while to figure out why in the world encryption had even been added to this. And I would kept getting sort of like, oh, we wanna make sure that this information is private. And I was like, it doesn't make sense. I can connect anywhere and and see this stuff.

[85:04] Finally found one of the people that had implemented it, and the the idea wasn't crazy. It had nothing to do with, I mean, I guess it had something to do with encryption, but but their thought process is that it was more about identity. They wanted, if once you join, you wanted to have essentially a cert that verified that you are who you say you are, and they wanted that there for the various extensions that they were putting in.

[85:36] And so okay. That that wasn't crazy. It was very annoying to me to spend a week of my life trying to implement. But the other thing that's kind of funny is that, and I maybe, Kieran, you know more from talking to people over the summer, but there was sort of a distrust in standards.

[85:58] And so, like, I think the thing that usual software engineer would do is be to actually get SSL and implement it with that, or or to take hash algorithms that were, that had a corporate stamp of approval and put that in. But they always wanted to sort of put things a little bit outside of there because I think they feared maybe truthfully of backdoors and all of these things.

[86:29] And so I essentially had to go and get a lot of nonstandard encryption algorithms and and paste them together into an SSL-like thing. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[86:42] Yeah. I can add a little bit on that. I would say the building blocks were at least semi standard. They use the same elliptic curve as Bitcoin for the actual signatures and transfer from the money and and all that. The algorithms that went into the reinvention of SSL, like, I think the building blocks were just normal stuff.

[87:08] They didn't invent hashing algorithms or signing algorithms and and all that sort of thing. But the composition is something you have to be quite careful about. They weren't they weren't just inventing encryption.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[87:21] So they were taking things that were were approved of, but they weren't taking things that were the standards.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[87:28] Exactly. That's right. And I think it did have to do a little bit with backdoor fear. But, also, I remember a comment one time, like, TCP has never been proven to be able to be the backbone of a peer to peer network. And there was some, like, I think BitTorrent maybe used UDP or something and plus something proprietary on top or something.

[87:54] There was the belief that the existing protocols were insufficient, and it might be right. It also might be just like going back to the point, like, they had a lot of money at this point. Like, they wanted to rebuild everything. So I think it's probably some mix of of those those things.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[88:14] I mean, for instance, the hashing algorithm that they chose to use in the early days was they were calling it SHA-3. And but SHA-3 hadn't been finalized at that point in time, so they were sort of taking the proposal. And and so I went and got the codes in the Haskell code base that did the proposed SHA-3 at that point in time.

[88:43] And then one day, I kind of went into the, I think, the C++ client and looked around, and they started calling it Keccak. And I was like, what? What what's going on here? Why did they change the algorithm? But it was still connecting to what I had there.

[89:03] So I was a little bit confused, and I found out later what had happened was there had been a last minute change in SHA-3, and the Ethereum team, felt that this was a government backdoor that was being put in there, and they refused to put that change in.

[89:25] And so they stuck with the original proposal, which was called Keccak, which is something that I had already implemented there. But but they aren't technically SHA-3 anymore. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[89:38] Gotcha.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[89:39] Yeah. Okay. I have a vague memory of that. Saying it was a government backdoor. I don't know one or the other, but that was their belief.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[89:47] Can you talk a little bit about okay. You're talking to Roman some at this time. Who's Roman? What was going on? I also remember the issue of sync, and I wanna you to say it, but I'll prompt you if if need be.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[90:06] Oh, this well, I remember I remember sync speed was okay. So— That's a yeah. Yeah. There were kinda like two tiers of of software developers in the original sort of test net. There were those who were around from the beginning that I was not in that group. Again, driving around country.

[90:33] But so and then and that included, I guess, Python, which was Vitalik's, C++, and and Geth were were first tier. Was there another first tier? I'm trying to remember.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[90:48] I think those were the three, like, foundation less sponsored ones.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[90:53] J in the original group, but then it got kind of—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[90:58] Pulled out perhaps? Pulled out. Yeah. Because I— Okay. I think I may, Roman might have worked for the foundation for a— And then yeah. Gotcha. I think he started a little bit similar to me because I first thought he was part of the foundation, but then I found out later he had been someone who came in a little bit later.

[91:17] And then maybe there were some, I don't know. Again, maybe you know more than I do, Kieran, but there was some, maybe, some arguing there or something, and so they weren't really communicating with him as much. Don't know if I got that right. But, but so, yeah, so that was the, so Roman,—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[91:37] was the Java client. What was Roman's last name?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[91:41] Mandeleil. Mandeleil. I don't know how to pronounce it.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[91:45] M-A-N-D-E-L-E-I-L. Some something like that. You can look at—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[91:50] It was Roman who did Java. Gavin was doing C++, and Jeff was doing Go, I think. And then we talked about Python. But Roman and I were the later guys.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[92:02] So and I did the Haskell client. And and Roman may or may not have been in the Ethereum Foundation. I was not in the Ethereum Foundation, but I met, I met with those guys a number of times. And but the thing that everybody, I guess what you were alluding to, I'm not sure what precisely the story is looking for, but but it was sync speed was the thing that everybody would compete against.

[92:33] And I remember going to various meetups, and Roman would always kinda run up to me, and he's like, how how long does it take you to sync up to a million blocks in in the test net now? And so there was always this competitiveness around sync speed, which is is an important thing, but there are other things too.

[92:57] So and so everybody was just rushing to to get sync speed faster and faster at that point in time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[93:04] So I the thing I wanted to capture is, like, in in some ways, one that seemed like a little juvenile at the time, but it was also genius. Like, you got a lot of technical energy all focused around this one thing, Ethereum. Like, these people probably could have tried to make their own Ethereum-like blockchain or Bitcoin-like blockchain or all that sort of thing.

[93:28] But it was sort of open source, made the best, get merged sort of attitude, and that it probably made for a better product at the end of the day. That was that was kind of the the main point that, like yeah. It was it it felt like nerdy kids playing with things. But it kinda works.

[93:53] I also remember they flooded the test nets with giant blocks of data at some point. There was a lot of, I felt like the, people were treating it like this is like a spacecraft launch. Like, you had to really stress test it because it's gonna be the new world computer.

[94:16] And so in some ways, while the the development was far more incremental than Bitcoin, there was still very stringent and perhaps unrealistic scenario testing that was going on before the launch.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[94:33] Well, and I think that's one thing that's kind of interesting about it also is that it was very meritocratic. Right? And and and there was all this competition going on, but even though, Gavin was technically CTO and and Vitalik is obviously Vitalik, but they didn't win.

[94:55] Like, the one that won was Jeff's Go client. The Go client. Right? Like and you could imagine in any other scenario, they could have just put their foot down and said, no. We're gonna go with Python or no. We're gonna go with C++. But they went with the one that actually performed the best and was doing the best.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[95:17] It it was a surprise to me. I was always treating C++ as the reference client. And Gavin was sort of more of a spokesman over there at the time. Jeff was sort of quieter. And at the last minute, I think there was some discussion about they needed to go through a security audit.

[95:40] And I, the story I heard, I don't know if it's true or not, is that they chose to do Geth first thinking that the c plus plus would be the last thing, and they would put that out there. But, he kinda quietly went through that. And, I honestly like, I don't know. Maybe I'll step on toes saying this.

[96:04] But from using all of these clients, the Geth was the most stable at the time. I would always like, I would start it, and I would run. C++ was changing a lot, and so often I would start it and, oh, it's not working today. I think that plus the security audit pushed it over, and people used that one a lot. So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[96:29] Yeah. Yeah. I have a similar memory. And, of course, Gavin went on later to create Parity, the Rust version, which I think got pretty popular. I'm not quite sure where what its where it stands today. So the talking about security, I wanna hone in on the theme of the shifting launch date.

[96:54] Jim, do you remember, or Victor too, we had started to work on kind of a company related to all this, and we're getting worried because they kept adding more stuff, basically. Do you wanna can you kinda go into our, anything you remember from that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[97:14] It would've continued except for a bit of unlock that in a way was lucky, is what ended up happening is Bitcoin crashed at that time. And it really put the fire under everybody's feet that they had to get this thing out immediately because the their holdings weren't in Bitcoin.

[97:34] And so I think if that hadn't happened, there wouldn't have been the pressure to push it out right then and there, and they might have just kept adding and modifying indefinitely after that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[97:47] So I believe the foundation was paying people sort of denominated in fiat currency, but with Bitcoin. So if it's x number of thousand euro or USD per month, they would, the the Bitcoin amount would vary. And, yes, to that end, they everyone I remember in that room at Zug, there was discussion of, like, well, what if Bitcoin goes to $10,000? Because that would be really high at that time. Like, we shouldn't convert it.

[98:21] And they ended up being right. I think the the prudent move would have been at least some diversification in the treasury. I believe they kept it all in Bitcoin and paid it out, I think, in Bitcoin. But, again, the the amount would vary. And, of course, some bills just had to be in euro or whatever, the the Swiss francs, if that's a or USD.

[98:50] And so there was no avoiding the fact that runway was shrinking from having brought in the roughly 22,000,000, ramping up big dev teams, lot of redundancy. So I think three full dev teams for the clients, maybe a half a dev team for Python because it was kind of just Vitalik working out how it all works.

[99:15] It was not gonna be as fast as the others because it was in Python. Then there was, I think they started paying the JavaScript people later. There's development of the Mist browser. There's the libraries and tooling started getting going. They were they were doing a lot. And almost all of it was technical. Not too much had a business development focus.

[99:42] And, yeah, then the the price drops, and suddenly, what had gone, I believe they had forecast a 2016 launch timeline, and it got moved up to maybe July 2015. So we're sitting there in in March. We're like, oh, you're telling us the thing is gonna launch in 2016. Like, should we be doing this? And then it moves up.

[100:10] And it was great that it moved up. Jim, do you recall, how do you remember how you predicted roughly when it would launch?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[100:20] No. I'm not sure what you're referring to.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[100:23] I think you plotted a commit graph where it was commits by day in the Ethereum repo. I remember best.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[100:32] Don't remember this, but okay. I don't doubt I did it. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[100:36] And so, like, they, the July date called a couple, was after the deadline had been moved a couple times. So, basically, they're running out of money. They moved the the deadline, the the launch date way up. Right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[100:51] And and they move it to, Spain. But I remember thinking very heavily about how it had been changing very quickly, and then it slowed down, and I was happy. Yeah. And I will say they that 2016—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[101:06] date happened after a series of changing dates because we're like, hey. We wanna launch this company, but we need, we were still connected to the, hopefully, the live net at the time. And so we were trying to time our thing, and they were changing dates all the time too.

[101:25] And so I think the 2016 date was the sort of last one before they kind of changed their mind and re refocused.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[101:34] There were many eras which everyone has copied since. There's like this is the, what were all the names? The serenity after it launched. There's metropolis. Serenity. Serenity. Yeah. They were epochs where there'd be testing of the software, and they they intended to stay in test net for quite a long time.

[102:01] That's the upshot. And I think they ended up crediting some of the test net mined ether, one to 10 again or 10 to one against real Ethereum to 10% of the value for the people who mined on the test net. So they made it kinda progressively more real, but it really was fortuitous that there was a price crash because we might never have seen it, might have never seen the light of day.

[102:33] So many of the— And I think you you didn't even elucidate,—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[102:37] like, all of the projects. Like, there was a Raspberry Pi client that had—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[102:42] I forgot about the Raspberry Pi client.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[102:44] There were so many projects. Like, it was, like we were, what is going on here?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[102:50] They built, okay. So there were many different, I think I said, there was Serpent, which was the Python-like language that compiled to EVM. There's Solidity, which won. So go, sorry. C++ lost, but Solidity won. Yeah. And Solidity was kinda put together by Gavin. It's sort of a C JavaScript looking language.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[103:16] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[103:17] There was another one. LLL. LLL. It's like a Lisp-like looking language. Like Lisp-like. To some extent, it it let the developers just be free to do things that developers always wanna do, like build peer to peer messaging systems, write compilers.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[103:39] Works. Exactly. Yeah. No. That was that was funny.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[103:43] Okay. Let's go to, because we can, get close to wrapping up here. And if, if there's interest, we could do another one of these, because there's lots after the launch. Let's go to kinda right before the launch. Okay. So as we're talking about the the launch run up, a bunch of interesting things happened.

[104:07] One, we had started to some extent working as part of ConsenSys. Yeah. So we kind of joined the company, and it, they functioned sort of as an incubator, basically, us, and and plenty of other firms, concepts, some of which stayed in house, some of which also spun out.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[104:34] Brooklyn was awesome too. I'd never been to Williamsburg or Bushwick, and and it was sort of moving in various locations there. So I was, I used to love coming and hanging out at the offices.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[104:47] Yeah. It was, ConsenSys got the the famous office on Bogart, but first was at an office by the water in Williamsburg.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[104:56] Was, like, something— It was in Greenpoint. I remember getting completely lost at one point and finding it and—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[105:04] Yeah. Williamsburg is great. I remember sitting there one day, and all of a sudden, everybody came screaming in, and and they were filming an episode of Girls outside. And so I ran outside and watched them film an episode of Girls or part of an episode of Girls, not the whole episode. No.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[105:24] Wow. Yeah. That was so okay. So that's—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[105:28] early. Was it at March, April? That was around yeah. I think it was April, May kind of thing. Well, we moved into the Bogart office just before the launch of Ethereum. In fact, we, one of the reasons we moved into that office a little bit earlier was so we'd have enough space to do a bigger hackathon.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[105:50] Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. I do remember that. So we're frantically building the software. We're starting to work with people from within ConsenSys. So we had some folks join the project, some of whom have gone on to big blockchain success. Should should we tell the the Tim story?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[106:13] Well, yeah. I mean, Tim, the founder of Truffle, helped us kind of build our first blockchain explorer. He was a brilliant developer back then and still remains a brilliant developer. Aaron, I think helped us kind of, he who went on to build MetaMask. We had lots of conversations with him about how to create our REST API and how it would work.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[106:39] I met up a couple times at my place in Berkeley with Aaron also. It was funny, like these folks would just come by and now they're sort of different levels of a big deal. Exactly. I feel like you should tell the hard hitting version of the Tim's story just so a little bit because it was funny in retrospect. Right?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[107:00] Well, I think the thing is that we were really focused on at the time, I think the first idea that we had with Block Apps was that we would create a REST API. And we, I come from sort of a lean startup background. Like, we really want to push deadlines. And at the time, people were more in an exploration mode. They were trying to do different things.

[107:28] And I was kind of ratcheting up the pressure to kind of present this at some, I don't know if it was a conference or some meetup in a particular night. And as I kind of ratcheted up the pressure to do that, people were like, you know, I think I wanna kind of pursue my other interests instead of working in this high pressure environment.

[107:51] And a lot of early ConsenSys was like that. Like, it was like different working styles and different methodologies. But in the end, it was kind of amazing the people who did stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[108:06] Yeah. I would say lots of really smart people and a lot of flow between projects. It was amorphous at the beginning. Yeah. There was a lot of excitement, but it was also hard to get someone who is assigned to your team to do the thing you expected.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[108:25] Well, it doesn't mean it's that there weren't team assignments. Right? Like, there weren't the teams— I mean, we had, we had—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[108:32] They were suggested. Exactly. Like—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[108:35] and and but people were just flowing in and out, which is great for creativity, but was hard when you were trying to make a deadline because when you're trying to make a deadline, there's always sort of not great things you have to do. Right? Like, you gotta work really long hours and that kind of stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[108:53] Yeah. And let me see. What I felt, so we kind of, we looked and saw in our early approach, some success at API companies. Like, chain.com was at the time touting a big list of customers that use their API. They then pivoted to a couple other things, more enterprise outlook, and then they kinda a little bit pivoted back and then were eventually bought by, sort of bought by Stellar, I believe.

[109:27] So there's some precedent for, like, okay. Let's let's have an API. Let's make this really easy for people to use, and this being the Ethereum network itself. And I think we found pretty—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[109:44] strong resistance to this idea. Oh, yeah. Do we do you wanna talk more about this stuff? I think while you guys were working on the client, what I was trying to do was build smart contract based applications. Right? And it was really like, you you described some of the tooling, right, which was Mist and for front ends and the languages were constantly changing.

[110:13] Like, a lot of this seemed to be an afterthought, like, okay, we're gonna solve that later on them, the puzzle. But it was impossible to build an application, share it around, just get something running quickly. And so, my background was like web and mobile startups and like the first thing you look for is a REST API, and I thought like, okay, if we're ever gonna get this ecosystem were to really work, we need to have something like that so people can build these applications on.

[110:49] We couldn't cobble together all these tools. But, yeah, we got a lot of resistance to it because people we were speaking Martian to people. Like, these are people, but they had no interest in anything that sounded a little bit corporate-y. So—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[111:08] Yeah. It wasn't even corporate-y. It was more like— like—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[111:12] There was a general suspicion of servers. I remember the phrase like, yeah. I don't know if I wanna work anything on anything that involves any servers. And I remember at the time, like, a peer to peer network, it's like every peer is both a client and a server. Like, it's sort of kind of intrinsic.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[111:35] Yeah. There was a lot of belief in the time that effectively everyone would run a node. And like, at some point, you'd run a node in your browser or run a node on your phone. And I'm like, look. I ran a mobile application company. Like, I know how big these clients are. Like, I don't want my—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[111:53] Things gonna get very hot.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[111:55] Yeah. Exactly. Like, burning my ass sitting in my pocket trying to mine ether. Right? So but, yeah, it was just very strange, though, these kind of conversations.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[112:07] Yeah. And kind of concurrently, so more aligned with our perspective, ConsenSys sort of grew an enterprise team, which focused sort of on advising big corporates on blockchain and then implementing it for them. And we kinda worked with them on go to market even before the launch of Ethereum, more after.

[112:30] So we kinda hold on that discussion maybe for a subsequent episode. But okay. What about, do you guys have any specific memories of the hackathons we did?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[112:44] So the first hackathon we did was in Greenpoint, and we basically, it was sort of internal to ConsenSys people, and I think it was mostly interns that kind of participated. We had a very crude version of our API working, and it was really over, I think over a forty eight hour period, no one could build anything, basically.

[113:15] Like, it was like, but I think the premise that people were coming up with to use our API to build stuff, we could see some potential in it. So people were doing interesting things like incentivizing location based scavenger hunts and other kind of things. And we found that interesting enough that, and I think this, that was in May, June 2015 by that time.

[113:45] And then we figured out that there was, the launch would probably happen in August of that year. And we're like, okay, let's take all the input we got from that hackathon and do it like a real hackathon. Like, get a bunch of participants, get a bunch of people involved, and try and get all the people from ConsenSys but people outside ConsenSys involved.

[114:12] And we were kind of targeting that day. So we were furiously trying to make our product more stable and work and take all the input we got from that first one into the second one. When we didn't know exact, I think the plan was to do it on the day of the launch of Ethereum, and but we didn't know the exact date yet. So we're just furiously—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[114:36] You said right before or right after? I can't remember. I think it was right after.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[114:41] Yeah. I think it was two days after or something like that. But it was in the same timing of the launch, basically. So, as far as I'm aware, that was the first Ethereum hackathon.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[114:56] I remember maybe it was the second or third one we met the Crane brothers.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[115:01] Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's right. Mhmm. They— Yeah. I think—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[115:05] that was the one right after the launch. That was, yeah, that was later.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[115:10] That was, didn't they? They didn't want the one at the launch. They want, so that hackathon where we met them was actually the first ConsenSys conference hackathon. I don't think that's true. I think that one was later. I think they— Oh, no. You don't like— Yeah. You're right. You're right. I think they came to the first, you you're right. I think they came to that very first hackathon. Yeah. So I think—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[115:32] or at least John did. Well, maybe both. Yeah. Yeah. They came to the second one, the first one right after the launch. Right? The yeah. This is funny. This is another foreshadowing for a future episode. But, yes, the IBM, they've been circling this this whole time, and they do appear in the next episode if it comes at the ConsenSys hackathon.

[115:59] Like, I remember us furiously and and just the uncertainty of the launch. I was like, I remember we had many, many conversations. Like, is this thing ever gonna launch? Like, we weren't sure if it would happen.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[116:15] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[116:16] Do you remember, okay. Let's talk quickly about the mining that we did, and this was all for the company. But do you do you recall what we we did at that time?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[116:28] Yeah. I totally remember. So I remember, well, at some point up to the launch, we realized, okay. If we were gonna help, if we were gonna help businesses or other groups build applications on the Ethereum, we would need ether to be able to pay for gas for those transactions.

[116:47] And so we're like, well, where are we gonna get this from? And I think the first thing that happened was you guys were like, oh, we need to build a mining rig. Right? I'll hand that over to you, Jim. I think that was—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[117:03] Kieran and I drove up to Fry's and picked up a bunch of components.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[117:08] We did. I and we we're kinda ready for it because we, I believe we had, you had helped me build just a workstation—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[117:17] Yeah. I think that's right. Or two before.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[117:20] Basically, the compile times on my laptop were double or quadruple what they were on the workstation. So it made a big productivity difference. Yeah. We went back, and, yeah, I think so I moved closer to campus at that time. We took a couple different shots at mining, but what did, I think so I, mine exploded. The power supply blew up. The graphics card was actually okay. Something happened to yours. I can't remember.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[117:51] Well, we got it going on eventually. But the part that was funny, I remember, is that we spent two or three days building these machines, getting it up, putting the software on, getting it running, hitting some problems. And it started like, ether started to dribble in at that point in time.

[118:12] So we're like, oh, this is awesome. And then we called up Victor, and he's like, yeah. In the last half hour, I just spun up a few machines at Amazon, and I'm getting as much ether as you guys are.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[118:24] Well, it was more than a few machines. So—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[118:27] like, I remember watching you guys build this and thinking, like, oh, like, this is gonna launch any day now. Right? Like, so I said, can someone give me an image of the Go client? So and I took that image, and I just put it on Amazon and a bunch of Spot instances.

[118:50] And at some point, I was running, and I just bought as many spot instances as were available. Like, whatever met my price I bought, and this was before mining was even known that this was something that happened. So I could still get it pretty cheap, and there weren't, the blockchain itself was small enough that you could sync up pretty fast even if you were starting—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[119:16] None of this is stuff you could do today. In fact, none of this is—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[119:19] Exactly. Well, and and it stopped being effective. Like, I mean, there, I remember at the point of the launch, I, you guys were saying, yeah. We got our first ether. And I was like, do you see this graph? Like, this is the total mining power of the Ethereum network. That large wedge, which was 25%, is me on Spot instances. No.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[119:47] God. We should've we should've cranked it up just another couple weeks longer.

**SPEAKER_02:**
[119:52] I don't. Well, I think by the time three days had passed, I'd I'd passed several thousand dollars. Like, our AWS bill was— Yeah. It seemed super expensive at the time. Super expensive at the time. And I was like, oh, wow. Like, this is good. But, yeah, we should I should have ran it a month, basically.

[120:18] And then it was pretty amazing. Because, like— Yes. I'm not a DevOps guy, but I was running hundreds of machines at a time, and it was just amazing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[120:30] One thing I I struggled to remember, how did they communicate that the network was ready to launch? Is it Twitter, email? Like, how did we even know? Like, we knew we kinda knew, I think it was, we knew from the commits that it was close. This is why I brought it up before. They're like, okay. They're slowing down. They're getting ready. But—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[120:55] I don't remember how they communicated it, but we were pretty involved in ConsenSys at those days, and everybody was talking about it. Yeah. And there were multiple groups there that were getting ready to spin up lots of mining. And so there was no there was no missing it at the time.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[121:16] Yeah. Yeah. This is—

**SPEAKER_02:**
[121:18] sorry. Go ahead. Sorry. Like, I said, I think there was, but, like, I think they announced the date, but there was still a lot of uncertainty whether they would meet that date or not. Right? And it turned out they did. Like, that did turn out to be the date. But everyone was kind of gearing up, but we were also getting ready. Like, oh, it might not happen that day. It might be a couple days later. It could be a couple months later. We just weren't sure.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[121:49] Yeah. Oh, man. Those those are some times for sure. Yeah. Okay. So I think this is a good wrapping point for this first episode. Hopefully, we'll see if we get any feedback from the Internet at large on whether we should keep going down this path.

[122:08] But quite the journey already. Lots of interesting things I've even remembered in the course of our couple hours here. Thanks, guys. Does feel like we should keep going with the story, but we'll see. Let's leave it as a cliffhanger, all of the excitement to come. Any final words?

**SPEAKER_02:**
[122:30] Well, I think it's funny. Even if you look at the beginning, you see the same patterns now where there's this huge amount of inflow and then what seemed at the time, like, tons of hype, but now is a trickle of hype. And and what seems like tons of capital, but now would be considered a trickle of capital.

[122:53] And then a kind of overconfidence and then a tightening, but then real technical stuff gets done in the tightening. It's funny how that pattern has played out so many times now. Yeah. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[123:08] It's a funny type of cyclical. Tell you about the time we saw Vitalik threw his shirt at someone.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[123:15] Oh, that's a good story. Yes. That is a really good story. The Vitalik shirt story is a good one. Alrighty. Let's let's end it here. Thanks, guys. We're doing this recording on a Sunday. Hope it entertains and informs the wider world, and we'll see you next time.
