SPEAKER_00: All right, well, welcome back, everybody. The first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter. I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video. And there have been a few people who reached out, who we've known a long time who really appreciated the content. One of them called it, you know, essential viewing. So anyway, we're back for another episode, so remind everybody. I'm KIERAN James Lubin, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co founders, Victor. Do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay. I'm Victor Wong, co founder and chief product officer of BlockApps.

SPEAKER_02: I'm James Hermos DIA or Jim, CTO and founder, co founder of BlockApps.

SPEAKER_00: All right, thank you. And so I believe where we left. So I can't watch video of myself, so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch. And there were some things we left out even prior to launch that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit and then go forward to all of the kind of after launch activity. So with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first consensus Dapathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building. You know, what, what we, what in those days were known as dapps, I guess some people still call it, but that seems to go on out of favor with blockchain applications. So the first idea was to really try to build blockchain applications directly on Ethereum. And that was in the first consensus office, which was like a very small co working space in like Greenpoint, I.

SPEAKER_00: Think it was water in. It was called Green desks, maybe green ducks.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's right.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's right next to the modern day Domino park, maybe a block away from there or so.

SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Yeah, that's right. So and it of course, Domino park did not exist at that time. In fact, Domino park went up really quickly and took me by surprise. I like looked up one day and there was like a big kind of well manicured park there.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, they kind of walled it off and so it just was like, I don't know, I thought it was like an abandoned site. And then one day all of a sudden the wall was gone and there was a beautiful. So.

SPEAKER_01: So at that, so at that event, you know, which was I think two months, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I. I Will say not. The concepts were really interesting. People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning. A consensus over that summer. And consensus at this point was only like, maybe 20 people at max.

SPEAKER_00: 20 or 30.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was really, really small. And, you know, some great concepts came up. But, like, even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time. Like, it was just impossible. Like, very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain was kind of impossible. Like, you could read the state off the blockchain, all this kind of stuff. So that kind of led into. Yeah, like, everything building in those days were incredibly hard. And that led into. So we decided at that event we were going to. At the launch of Ethereum, we were going to do a bigger hackathon. And that became the second consensus Dappathon, which kind of coincided with the launch of Ethereum. And it was us, you know, the Java client, which I think was called Ethercap at that time, and, like, other tools that were kind of combined together. But what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger. Like, I think the first one we had like six participants. The other one we had, like, I think close to 30. And. But it introduced, like, a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly. Like, the winner was a gamefi app. Like, it really had that. That element of tokenized gameplay. There was a decentralized social app, I think, called Truther or something. Some. Something like that. And then there was like a traceability supply chain app in those early days. And that kind of all coincided with, like, the launch of Ethereum.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So, okay, and this. So. So you're talking about the second one.

SPEAKER_01: I'm talking about the second one.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the second one. Also, the offices had shifted. So we had our consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, which is. I. I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone mostly remote. I remember there was like a. There's like a horse Lineage app. Yeah, pretty interesting, you know, um, and we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in. In the hackathon. But that one was open to externals. Right. So that was the big difference. And it actually was, you know, quite well attended. The room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall. And you think that one was like 24 hours or it was two days. I can't remember.

SPEAKER_01: I think it was two days. And yeah, like the air conditioning thing. So we move. Moved into that space to have the hackathon, like, you know, consensus was playing because they had outgrown that co working space already. And so we moved into that space, which can, you know, was a reasonably sized room. Like, you could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room. Right. But yes, the air conditioning was terrible and we had to frantically. We only realized this after we got into the room, so we had to like, frantically buy some and set them up.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, I do have a memory of that.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't know if you recall that, but yeah, we were like, trying to like, get those air conditioning units in place before a ton of people showed up because, yeah, like, we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room.

SPEAKER_00: These were the scrappy days.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Manually configuring air conditioning. I think the amount of like, furniture assembly that you do is like a good proxy for you are in. In your startup journey.

SPEAKER_01: There was a lot of furniture. I mean, we, we like. It was basically an empty room when we moved in there. And I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started. So get everything running.

SPEAKER_00: And was this to like, sort of commemorate the launch, I think, or was it like right before the launch?

SPEAKER_01: It was, it was, it was right. It actually, you know, if you recall, at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be. Like, the. The dates were always shifting. Right. And we just said we kind of arbitrarily chose, like, we wanted to actually synchronize it with the launch, but because it was. Because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was, and even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague. Like, we were like, is that going to actually happen? So we. We kind of at some point had to arbitrarily chose the date and they. They more or less. What was the right date? Like, I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So, okay, and this. So. So you're talking about the second one.

SPEAKER_01: I'm talking about the second one.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the second one. Also, the offices had shifted. So we had our consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, which is. I.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Manually configuring air conditioning. I think the amount of like, furniture assembly that you do is like a good proxy for you are in. In your startup journey.

We kind of at some point had to arbitrarily chose the date and they. They more or less. What was the right date? Like, I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So, okay, I'll transition into the DAO part. I'm going to go slightly out of order here. So, Victor, what was the DAO?

SPEAKER_01: So the DAO was basically, it was kind of like a investment fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Right. So basically people would put like money into this contract and this contract would basically fund the. The goal of it was it would fund different projects, but it started to like consume a huge amount of, you know, the overall ether supply. I think it was as high as like 20 or 25% of the entire ether supply got locked up into this contract.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm looking on the Wikipedia right now. So the part of the reason I thought of it in this sequence is like looking at the price action. Part of it is that the supply, the extant ether supply went down because. Okay, so as of May 2016, the DAO had attracted nearly 14% of all ether tokens issued to date. So they ran a crowd sale and crowd sale raised $34 million, 34 million by May 10, 2016, more than 50 by May 12, over 100 by May 15. So sometimes the dynamics of these ICOs, this is one thing, one. It's kind of crazy, but like one thing that blockchain seem to do that are. It's really difficult to do with other technologies is to have this sort of really large scale collaboration and in this case to pool capital, basically. So I suppose the. There was a. Some sort of virality going on. People are talking about the DAO and you just see this like enormous movement of funds sort of overnight and you know, so okay, by the. They end up holding by May 21, 2016, over $150 million in ether from over 10,000 people. Which is about. It says, according to the article, about 14% of all ether tokens issued at that time.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, so it was really fast, right? Like it took everybody's surprise. I remember, I think I had a meeting that the enterprise folks at Consensus had set up with, I'm gonna say the people at BVVA forgetting last names, but I think it was with like Scarlet and Carlos. I don't think you went to this one, Vic. I think you were in town. But they were just like, it just caught everyone's attention. It was crazy, you know, and they were, we were talking a bit about like operational use cases for the bank. But then it was also like, you know, there was a sense that like this is where the future is. Like the money just moved, you know, like there were no really, you know, there's heavy subscription agreements and you know, all that sort of thing. And you know, it was also a cautionary tale of what was to come over the next couple years. Yeah. So by, by June, the people discovered that you could exploit the DAO to siphon off the funds. Do you remember anything about that beyond, you know, it was crazy.

SPEAKER_01: So, so there were. So you had all the supply locked into this contract and I think the hack was like. Yeah, so there was this massive race between. There was a flaw in the contract logic and because it's immutable, the smart contract couldn't be changed. Right. And when people realized There was this massive race between the people who were trying to extract the money out of the contract and the people who actually worked on the DAO itself. So it was like this. But the people who were successful at kind of extracting the money pulled out a lot of it. Like, I think, I don't remember the number, but I think it was like a huge amount of the value. They were able to pull that out.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Now the, the, the ironic thing was that it got pulled out and put into an account and everyone knew where it went because, you know, everything on the blockchain is completely transparent, but no one could do anything about it. Like they couldn't take the money out. And so the money was just sitting there, basically that got like. It was like it got stolen and left on the side of the street or something. And no one knew what to do about this situation.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. And so, okay, I'm kind of looking back on it. So it was, yeah, it blew up and it also caused the creation to. I remember there was a, at this time and we had to implement this in our software, a hard fork debate because. So it's pretty early. It's like less than a year after Ethereum launched. Probably a lot of the, you know, big ether holders participated in this. You know, they've lost significant funds, maybe all of their funds. And the question was like, do you make people whole or do you stick true to the absolute, you know, immutability of, you know, in, in the.

SPEAKER_01: In.

SPEAKER_00: The classic blockchain sense where, you know, it's totally buyer beware. Shouldn't have put your Ether in this contract if you weren't going to, you know, if you weren't prepared to lose it. And the refund group one. So in a sense, I mean, both, like Ethereum, Bitcoin, really all the projects are governed to an extent. Right. By the people who develop the software and kind of on an ongoing basis, discuss additions to the protocol, et cetera, et cetera. Right. And even in the early days of Bitcoin, I was not really around for this, but supposedly they had to be extremely creative about having, about keeping the protocol running while not ever reverting any of the history. Right. So I don't believe they did. They've ever done a hard fork of the nature described here, though there have been maybe not sponsored by the founders. Obviously there are forks of bitcoin now, Bitcoin cash, you know, all that sort of thing. And so the Ethereum community elected to, or the foundation or whatever that is, elected to sort of Forcibly revert the funds. There's just like a credit as of a certain block number. So everyone got their funds back. Jim had to code it. Maybe I helped a little bit. Now I was not coding anymore at this point. And so then Ethereum Classic was like the hard line. Like we're sticking the immutability. Sorry, Jim, are you going to say something? Oh no, Victor, you're going to say something.

SPEAKER_01: No, no.

SPEAKER_00: And so Ethereum Classic got some backers, I think maybe famously, I think Barry Silbert was in their Ethereum Classic, maybe still is. And eventually it was, I think someday. Victor, you told me this, right? Someday later it had a hard fork itself. Right. When some issue was discovered with the protocol. Is that correct?

SPEAKER_01: I think, I don't know if it was a hard fork or a soft fork, but yeah, there have been like, you know, there have been debates inside. There have been debates inside the Ethereum Classic community too on how to implement different changes into the protocol. Right. It's not just running like there's constantly. I think Bob Summarial of the Ethereum Classic Collective knows more about this stuff than I do.

SPEAKER_00: Interesting. Yeah. Maybe I could follow up on exactly how this went down. But I think also I think Ethereum Classic maybe was mining forever philosophically.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Whereas Ethereum switched over to proof of stake like a year ago. Yeah. You know, you're now.

SPEAKER_01: So.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, they were more kind of. Although there was. Okay, yeah. I just googled it. Here's a June 28th Cointelegraph article that says Ethereum Classic devs announce upcoming hard fork, yada yada. So they at least subsequently did some amount of hard forking. But you know, interesting nonetheless. Funny thing also when this, this hard fork happens, right. It's, you know, you don't. This is a silly comment from someone who's, you know, fairly compliance focused. Right. Like, what's the tax treatment of a hard fork? Like you had some say you had some tokens on one chain and then they morph and now you have tokens on both chains. I think it's like airdrops too are like ordinary income, which means whether or not you wanted those hard fork coins, you know, you, you probably have to pay taxes on them if you can access and liquidate them. But you have to pay them whether or not you liquidate. It's not just capital gains, you know, so interesting. Quite a, quite a strange test of our system that we've seen with Blockchain because, you know, they fork all the time. There's lots of airdrops Et cetera. And you might not even be aware. All right, so that was the DAO. I want to. Yeah, this was crazy. Like I still kind of can't believe this happened and it's happened way bigger and differently later. But you know, it, it's, yeah, it was quite a moment, you know, all of this.

SPEAKER_01: Well, I, I, I, I looked up the current price and in current dollars it would be roughly the equivalent of $30 billion if you think about it. So yeah, it'd be huge, you know, like because just Ethereum was so small at the time.

SPEAKER_00: Right, yeah. Okay, I want to take you to the second CoinDesk Consensus Hackathon and again hand it to Victor for everything you recall. Also we have some pictures from that time. Do you just show some of that on screen?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I found, I found it from CoinDesk. Let me see if I can still find them. But so what I remember of it is that it was, I think it was one of the first CoinDesk consensus events which you know, subsequently became huge. And then so they, they kind of had two events around it. One was a hackathon which we were part of and then, and we were running, we were like one of the main platforms forms that was participating in it and then there was the event itself which was I think at the Ritz. Like both events were in Times Square. Like the hackathon came first at Microsoft in Times Square and then the event was kind of, you know, a couple blocks away in the hotel. And I remember that like during the hackathon itself we were in all in these like different conference rooms that, and there was you know, like early Hyperledger and some other, I can't remember who the other clients were, but there were like competing clients that were not Ethereum based. And there was a pretty good turnout I think like over a hundred people showed up. Like a lot of people kind of showed up and our room got so crowded we had to like co opt another boardroom in order to kind of like build. So like I think we got like a significant majority of the developers building stuff on our platform which was super exciting. And I remember kind of walking by the rooms that like Hyperledger had had or I'm trying to remember what the other client had and like you know there weren't very many people in there. It seemed like the people that were in there were like people who were working for them. So that was really, really exciting though at the end we didn't win. At least someone building on our stack didn't win. Because I think the winner was actually something that was getting built way before that hackathon existed, which was, you know, technically against the rules, but we didn't, we didn't hold any window. This is.

SPEAKER_00: Victor asserts, if we lost, it's because someone else cheated. So.

SPEAKER_01: Exactly.

SPEAKER_00: That's, that's how we feel.

SPEAKER_01: That's at least how I felt at the time. Whether or not that's completely true, it's, you know, that memory is subjective. That's all I say. Right.

SPEAKER_00: And the, the, the rest of the conference.

SPEAKER_01: Oh, and then the rest of the conference. So that I think was like the first shiny big blockchain conference, right? Like, you know, you had, I remember Vitalik speaking. They launched, I think the first Hyperledger app there. And a bunch of, you know, there was a bunch of activity. Like it was a really interesting combination because most of the other conferences like DevCon are really developer focused, but this, you could really see a lot of businesses becoming interested in. And the thing I most remember about that conference is that we were like pulled into a room at one point and that room was basically in the room was the head of Hyperledger. John Woolpert and Vitalik were in that room and they were like, hey, we heard that you guys have an enterprise ready version of Ethereum that you know, can switch between the public net and like private blockchains, right? And, and like I remember Wolpert at the time was like, my engineers claim that this is completely impossible. Like, and Jim, I think you like pulled off your laptop and you're like, here it is. Like, I'm gonna show you like, this is, this is how it works. And you know, like you can start building on it and everything. And there was this conversation going back and forth between Wolpert and Vitalik about I think Hyperledger supporting Ethereum. And it kind of ended. What I remember of it was it ended with, I think Vitalik was, you know, he always wears an Ethereum T shirt, right? And Wolpert is about three size larger than Vitalik. But interesting.

SPEAKER_00: I think Vitalik is very tall, stockier, substantial. If they had a bench press competition, I expect there would be a pretty big differentiation, you know, in what John could venture what Vitalik adventure.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I, I think you're right. Like, it's not, we're not talking that John is unfit. He's just like much larger. And Vitalic is what at, you know, still quite skinny, right? So like John was like three sizes before and I think it was Andrew Keys that like pointed to The T shirt and like Vitalik, take that shirt off and give it to John because he was about to walk on stage and like it was like a muscle shirt on him. It was like so tight, you know, it was like a compression shirt. And he went on stage and that was like, you know, people were kind of shocked that like hey, what's going on? Like this. I had a Viper ledger and now he's wearing an Ethereum T shirt. And it's interesting because what. Eventually that led to Hyperledger actually supporting Ethereum type clients like Burrow.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah I would add in talking to. Obviously we, we spoke to John occasionally over the years and he actually went on to join consensus later. I don't really know what he's up to today. I don't think he's there anymore. But he had sort of a sense of like not wanting to be on the wrong side of history. Like he always wanted to talk about, he was always talking about like IBM's embrace of Linux as a. Instead of like pushing really hard on a continual basis with its own operating system. So they just put a ton of open source software development in Linux and of course it probably helped them, you know, have something to run on their mainframes which is still actually a big business for them today. And so he was always like debating back and forth like should we do our own thing? And it is, it was at least mostly open source. Should we go the, you know, the Ethereum way? What do we do? And I think this was you know, like perhaps the best illustration of that, that conflict I think IBM has since, you know, it's, it's. It was formidable for a while and sort of scary as a competitor and all that sort of thing. And I don't hear that much blockchain noise out of them anymore. I think they've shifted resources and all that sort of thing.

SPEAKER_01: By the way, I did find the picture from that first hackathon. So you know this is off of Coindesk but here's the picture, you know, at the mic and this was one of the rooms and there was, we had to co op another room like this was very early in the process.

SPEAKER_00: Y. Yep, I remember this one and.

SPEAKER_01: Here I am sitting in the middle of it over here. But yes, but yeah, it grew really, really rapidly.

SPEAKER_00: Alrighty. Close to rounding up here but got a couple more things. So things are moving along. 2016, there's some kind of organic momentum. I know like we hired a lot of people during this period of time we're deliver, you know, Our software has been used in enterprise projects. We're kind of like ramping up headcount because people are using our software more. And so I'm looking at this and like I can't believe that the timeframe were this tight. So DEFCON 2 is September 2016 and so it's in Shanghai. Right. So I do remember having to deal with all the Visa stuff. The, you know, thankfully Consensus dealt with that. We were kind of doing a capital raise, sort of our first sort of seedish one at that time. But it was, it felt like a coming out party. I don't know, I think, what do you guys recall? What are some of your impressions from Devcon 2? Kind of, Etc.

SPEAKER_02: There was some big attack on Ethereum. I'm trying to remember the details right now, but I remember in the morning and lots of stuff was happening on the business front there. But I remember waking up and suddenly I was just completely involved in like digging in with the Haskell client and, and figuring out what was going on and what changes we had to make.

SPEAKER_01: So I do remember it was like.

SPEAKER_00: Transactions that slowed the clients down being created. Right. And yeah, I, I think like, I guess it was like due to the way the data structures worked to some extent, it was like hard to make them process fast. I, I, I can't recall. But yeah, it was funny that it was right around that time also. Okay, so good.

SPEAKER_02: Well, the funny thing that I sort of remember is like, and maybe you're about to talk about this, but, but the EAA was sort of formed during that conference and Victor somehow in the morning grabbed me and he's like, I've got all these meetings and I'd like you to come along too. But I was like, I had my laptop and I was like trying to dig into the tech with all this stuff that was going on there. So I sort of sat in the corner in this coffee shop and I was like programming all day and then at the end of the day I kind of was like, what were all those meetings you had? And Victor essentially is like, oh yeah, we just formed the eea.

SPEAKER_01: Well, I, yeah, it was funny. I, I think really it was Jeremy Miller, who I think later went on to become chief of staff for Consensus, who really kind of drove that.
