SPEAKER_04: All right, well, welcome back everybody. Um, the first episode of the early days of Ethereum actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter. I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video. Um, and there have been a few people who reached out who we've known a long time, who really appreciated the content. One of them called it, you know, essential viewing. So, anyway, we're back for another episode. So, remind everybody, I'm Kieran James Leuven, CEO of BlockApps, here with my co-founders. Victor, do you want to introduce yourself quickly? Oh, okay. I'm Victor Wong, co-founder and chief product officer of BlockApps. I'm James Hermosdia, or Jim, CTO and co-founder of BlockApps. All right, thank you. And so, I believe where we left off, so I can't watch... video of myself, so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch, and there were some things we left out, even prior to launch, that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit, and then go forward to all of the kind of after-launch activity. So, with that said, um, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first Consensus Dappathon, which was, uh, June 2015, I believe.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon building, you know, um, what we, what in those days were known as daps, I guess some people still call it, but that seems to go now in favor with blockchain applications. So, the first idea was to really try to build um blockchain applications directly on Ethereum, and that was in the first Consensus office, which was like a very small co-working space in like Greenpoint, I think I would say it was water in, yeah, um, it was called Green Desks, maybe.

SPEAKER_02: Green dust, yeah, that's right, yeah, it's right next to the modern-day Domino Park, uh, maybe a block away from there or so, exactly, yeah, that's right. So, and it, of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time, in fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise. I like looked up one day, and there was like a big kind of well-manicured park there.

SPEAKER_00: So, at that event, which was, I think, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say the concepts were really interesting. People were coming up. And it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer. And ConsenSys at this point was only like maybe 20 people at max, 20 or 30, yeah, that's interesting. It was really, really small, and, you know, some great concepts came up. But, like, even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that no one could build anything in a short period of time. Like, it was just impossible, like very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain was kind of impossible. Like, you couldn't read the state off the blockchain, and all this kind of stuff. So, that kind of led into, yeah, like everything building in those days were incredibly hard, and that led into, so we decided at that event, we were gonna, at the launch of Ethereum, we were going to do a bigger hackathon, and um, that became the second Consensus Dappathon, which coincided with the launch of Ethereum, and it was us, um, you know, the Java client, which I think was called Ether Camp at that time, um, and like other tools that were kind of combined together, but what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger, like I think the first one we had like six participants, the other one we had like I think close to 30, and um, but it introduced like a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly, like what the winner was, a game, fire app, like it really had that element of tokenized gameplay, there was a decentralized social app, I think called Truther or something, and then um, there was like a traceability supply chain app, in those early days, and that kind of all coincided, uh, with like the launch of Ethereum.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so, okay, in this, so, you're talking about the second one, I'm talking about the second one, yeah, the second one also, the offices had shifted, so we had, um, our Consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of at that time, uh, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, um, which is, uh, I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone, um, mostly remote. I remember there was like a, there's like a horse lineage app, yeah, yeah, interesting, you know, um, and we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon, but that one was, uh, open to externals, right, so that was the big difference, and it actually was, you know, quite well-attended, um, the room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall, um, and you think that one was like 24 hours or it was two days, I can't, I think it was two days, and yeah, like the air conditioning thing.

SPEAKER_00: So, we moved into that space to have the hackathon, like, you know, Consensus was playing because they had outgrown that co-working space already, and so we moved into that space, which can, you know, was a reasonably sized room, like you could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room, right, but, yes, the air conditioning was terrible, and we had to frantically, um, we only realized this after we got into the room, so we had to, like, frantically buy something, set them up, okay, I do have a memory of that. Yeah, I don't know if you recall that, but, yeah, we were like trying to, like, get those air conditioning units in place before a ton of people showed up, because, yeah, like we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room, these were the scrappy days, yeah, manually configuring air condition, I think the amount of, like, furniture assembly that you do is, like, a good proxy for, you are in, in your startup journey, there was a lot of furniture, I mean, we, we, like, it was basically an empty room when we moved in there, and I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started, so we had to get everything up and running, and it was, this, to, like, sort of commemorate the launch, I think, or was it, like, right before the launch, it was, it was, it was right, it actually, you know, if, if you recall, at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be, like, this, the, the dates were always shifting, right, and we just said, we kind of arbitrarily chose, like, we wanted to, actually, synchronize it with the launch, but because it was, because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was, and even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague, like, we're, like, exactly what actually happened, so we, we, have, at some point, had to arbitrarily choose the date, and they, they, more or less, what was the right date, like, I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

SPEAKER_04: Jim, I might have asked you this last episode, but I'll ask again. Do you remember, one, trying to predict the launch, and could you explain how? And two, there was some complicated mechanism for how the launch would actually happen, because it's hard for, like, a decentralized group to decide on a launch time. I can't remember that at all. You were mentioning it in the last video, and I didn't remember this, but I don't doubt it. It sounds correct. You were saying, we were looking through the Git commits at the time, we were, yes, you know, you made this plot, it was like commits by day, and as, like, the commits, and you, like, extrapolated it, for, it, I think, probably got within a couple days of the launch date, but... okay, so, I have to, yeah, I still don't know how they, like, set the clock on the first block, so to speak, maybe we can, like, dig this up, there was something they did, um, and that we had, probably, in our DMs, I, I, wish I thought to look between the first and second video to find the actual discussion that we had, maybe the graph is in there, yeah, yeah, that's very funny, the Slack is the treasure trove of, uh, interesting things, um, all right, uh, so, yeah, so, it launched, um, and I kind of felt like there was a sort of, and then what, going on, you know, it took a little time for things to get going, and then, you know, this, it, obviously, it's been a smashing success, right, it's just sort of the reality of a new platform, you sort of get it out there.

SPEAKER_02: You see what people do, you learn from it, and you know, it took a minute for the activity to kick in, I remember, like, a lot of people around us, at the time, had been buying a lot of pre-sale Ether beforehand, and so, the day it came out, I think they were expecting it to, like, have a huge jump in value immediately, and when, when, like, you know, a couple weeks had gone by, and it was only, uh, still, like, 20 cents in Ether, so I remember people around us were kind of, like, some of the people there were, like, oh, this thing was a flop, it's never gonna go anywhere, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's just psychologically, yeah, the expectations were super high, there was this concept floating on Consensus of day one daps, like, yeah, I had to be ready, right, for the launch, because, you know, it was a land grab, and things were going to the moon, and you know, it turned out, you know, not quite, obviously, again, smashing success, but, yeah, the price is, like, under a dollar for a little bit, and then, around a dollar, for, like, a while, I believe, um, and I did want to mention, so, um, I had to look this up, so, the first ICO, whatever you want to call it, that was on Ethereum, obviously, Ethereum did its own crowd sale, um, but it was, like, uh, you know, they took in Bitcoin, and there was, it was, something like, two thousand Ether to one Bitcoin, at the time, which, I believe, at the time, was, like, 20 or 30 cents, and then it had gone up to a dollar, on launch, which is already a pretty good return, you know, but, that is what it is, the first ICO, apparently, was Augur, and I knew the Augur guys a little bit, I was digging through the CryptoEconomicon videos, I believe, one or two of them presented, or run panels, at CryptoEconomicon, for folks who are listening to this, CryptoEconomicon was a conference that we had, in January 2015, that involved a lot of the people who then, including, metallic, and some of the other Ethereum folks, um, then, subsequently, created, really big, and interesting, mostly layer one projects, in the Ethereum space, but others, as well, so, the videos are actually up, I tweeted a couple of them, but there was, apparently, I think, I created a YouTube channel, like, in 2015, and uploaded all those, I definitely remember getting them recorded, so, check those out, if that's of interest, so, Augur was the first, I guess, of the prediction markets platforms, there have since been a couple of new ones, that have popped up, that seem to be popular, there was also this sort of competing project, called Truthcoin, um, and I was kind of confused about how the two related to each other, um, I think there was no formal relation, though, I remember meeting up, there's getting Matt Liston, I met, who, I checked his LinkedIn, he's been, a different couple, different places, so, I think, Augur, uh, maybe, we should look up, who actually founded Augur, so, Jeremy Gardner, I, you know, I've known, over the years, I met him, in San Francisco, with Vitalik, because, metallic, was staying, at what was turned, at the time, the Crypto Castle, um, and, you know, it's kind of, what you would imagine, sort of, like a co-working, co-living, um, crypto space, for, and, not everyone there, was working on Augur, they're all working on different things, it's kind of, common, uh, thing to do, well, I, I, think, if you hear the term Crypto Castle, now, people would imagine, an actual Castle, say, you know, what you're describing, which is more like a dormitory, yes, it was more like a dorm, I mean, it was a nice, nice little house, I think, I, I, can't remember, it might have been, like, adjacent to the mission, in, in San Francisco, um, and, so, Vitalik, would stay there, sometimes, Joey Krug, I've, probably, met, two or three times, over the years, I'm not even sure, if I ever met Jack Peterson, so, those are the three founders of Augur, so, I guess, they were, good friends, with Vitalik, or just, sort of, had realized, early on, that it would be easier to develop, on Ethereum, than it would be, to try to do something, with Bitcoin, which was, kind of, the predominant suggestion, at the time, but, they did, the first, on Ethereum, um, um, crowdfund, um, like, I guess, right after launch, the Wikipedia, is saying, August 2015, um, which is, really, really early, I don't know, if I believe, this Wikipedia page, it says, soon after the platform launched, users had created, the death pools, or assassination markets, on famous people, so, back in 2015, every discussion, about blockchain, Justin Delacruz, Ph.D., eventually, led, both, to prediction markets, and then, this sort of, uncensored ability, you can't shut it down, would lead, then, to assassination markets, um, assassination markets, being, you predict, you bet, on the day, someone dies, you know, and then, someone takes the other side, of that bet, Justin Delacruz, kills them, and collects, on it, so, apparently, they're, actually, were, assassination markets, created, on Augur, according to, this Wikipedia page, I'm, yeah, I have to look into that, I'm, a little bit, dubious, but, in any case, um, Augur, then, blazed the trail, sort of, after, a theory, ended, with a successful crowd sale, um, for the wave, of ICOs, that, that, came later, um, but, yeah, so, Truthcoin, was, also, this competing project, I just remember, meeting up, with Matt, at, like, a Berkeley coffee shop, and talking, about, both Augur, and Truthcoin, had some sort of, David Price, you know, machine learning, slightly, like, computer science, graph theoretic way, of, like, determining, what the truth was, so, like, you take a bunch of votes, from a bunch of people, but then, determine, the principal components, of, how the voting is, an extract, the truth, from there, was, it was, sounded, like, very, you know, high-end math, mechanistic, which, it was, very common, of the space, every, like, you know, the crypto, has a lot of these, like, and, I was, in the math department, a lot of these, like, mathematician types, who, like, kind of, came in, and wanted to create, like, really complicated schemes, and mechanisms, and all that sort of stuff, that had provable, theoretical properties, for something, interesting, about, you know, this space, but, yeah, I'm, so, so, they must have launched, it, like, right away, that's, very interesting, I remember, us talking, to them, at some point, and they were, developing, that, like, they did want to be, a day one Dapp, I remember, and they were, I think, the platform, went live, 2018, the Wikipedia page says, but they did, the crowd sale, like, basically, right away, right, right, um, so, should we go on, to DevCon 1, which, I guess, I can talk about, so, kind of, concurrently, while all this is happening, we started to work, a bunch, so, ConsenSys, had a business development team, a little bit, of a mix, uh, marketing, BD, actual sales, you know, etc, that, um, was starting to generate interest, from big companies, in the technology, so, um, you know, uh, for us, ourselves, we definitely worked, with companies, far more, than, sort of, the crypto public, for, you know, most of the history, of the company, um, still, don't really work, with the crypto public, today, um, but, you know, ConsenSys, was kind of, conflicted, on this front, so, they, you know, what, they, they had, sort of, pure blockchain, native project, and eventually, in big numbers, they also had an enterprise arm, which is, really, more, consulting, oriented, although, they, kind of, ended up, sort of, backfilling, what they saw, demand, for, with products, at times, but, in any case, the BD folks, were reaching out, to everybody, and they, actually, got, a fair bit, of interest, from Microsoft, and I think, Microsoft, had already, been, kind of, watching, the Ethereum revolution, and seeing, it, as something, interesting, the new front, of the cloud war, perhaps, and, so, you know, we got, to working, with them, and I should, maybe, for the technical part, of this, I could, kind of, transition, but, basically, so, ConsenSys, had a couple, you know, preferred projects, which had the low-level, you know, like, low-level, I mean, like, the blockchain client, itself, infrastructure, that could be deployed, on cloud platforms, and maybe, yeah, so, that, ended up, being, basically, us, and the, you know, the Java folks, um.

SPEAKER_00: Vic, do you want to take any? I think you were saying, before, yeah, sure, so, they were interested, in kind of, being able to deploy, one of the clients, that we had, we had the Haskell client, and then, the Java folks, they were, actually, more interested, in the Java folks, wait, I should take a step back, here, just, mentioning, that, DevCon 1, almost, didn't happen, if you recall, right, because, it was, in this low period, and the Ethereum foundation, was, kind of, running out, of money, because, you know, this is, why, the launch, had to happen, when it happened, and, in that low period, they were, like, you know, still trying, to preserve, a lot, of cash, and, so, it, almost, didn't happen, and, I remember, like, a lot, of people, inside ConsenSys, were, like, no, like, we have to, like, bring, this, to, kind of, bring, this, up, and make, an event, out of this, you know, like, I think, Andrew Keyes, was leading, the charge, in that, really, saying, like, we got, to do, this, and, then, this, Microsoft thing, kind of, bundled, into, that, right, so, it was, us, and the Java client, and, my background, was, like, you know, in my previous company, I had tried, to work, with Microsoft, and, building, apps, like, when they had, their first, mobile platform, and, it took me, like, six months, to get, a meeting, and, I had, a cousin, who was, like, a VP, at Microsoft, so, it was, amazing, to me, that, they were, just, coming, to us, and, they wanted, to launch, something, with us, in two months, and, I think, at that point, we decided, okay, this is, a huge opportunity, we're, going, to drop, everything, and, focus, on, that, launch, which, turned out, to be, the launch, of Blockchain, as a Service, but, oddly, enough, the Java guys, started, and, then, they, just, kind of, faded, away, like, they, they, weren't, really, interested, in, kind of, pursuing, it, um, they, just, had, other things, going, on, so, we, we, like, went, over, it, so, by the time, DevCon 1, happened, the only thing, that was working, was, you know, our client, on it, was ready, on the cloud, you could, download, it, and, you could, start, building, on it, right away, and, then, remember, we started, to get, downloads, immediately, people, started, to get, people, using, it, immediately, but, that's, also, in that, run-up, that, was, when, we realized, when Microsoft realized, if we're, going, to make, this, as a developer tool, it can't connect, to the public Ethereum network, because, people, wouldn't, be able, to get, Ether, it was, quite, hard, to get, Ether, at that point, there, weren't, really, that many, exchanges, or, anything, to go, on, that's, how, we created, private Ethereum, and, private, enterprise, what became, known, as private Ethereum, or enterprise Ethereum.

SPEAKER_04: That, that, kind of, all, led, up, and, then, the launch, itself, in London, um, when we got, up, with Microsoft, I think, people, were shocked, that Microsoft, was, into, it, you know, so, uh, I just, looked, that, up, and, didn't, have, in our little outline, but I, I, had, forgotten, about, this, so, I think, Coinbase, listed, Ether, like, mid, 2016, right, I'm, seeing, May 24th, 2016.

SPEAKER_00: So, and, I, I, guess, like, Kraken, was, the popular, exchange, at the time, you know, I think, it was, Poloniex, I'm, sorry, you're, right, yeah, Poloniex, still, exists, and, I just, remember, there, was, like, the chat function, on Poloniex, and, like, man, like, that, was, like, crazy, like, that, was, Discord, before, there, was, Discord.

SPEAKER_04: Oh, wait, hold on, Circle, bought, it, maybe, and, then, it, seems, to have, shut, it, down, anyway, I'm, confused, by, all, this, but, yeah, so, it, was, like, it, was, sketchy, for, sure, um, it, was, like, a whale, chat, box, I never, really, used, it, but, I would, like, to see, it, on people's, computers, and, all, that, sort of, thing, it, was, um, it, was, difficult, to get, it, in, and, out, of Ether, for, a while, Jim, are you, gonna, say, something.

SPEAKER_02: I'm, just, kind of, remembering, back, then, remind me, because, I'm, sort of, like, not, sure, if I've, got, this, straight, but, I think, maybe, you're, downplaying, the Java thing, a little bit, I think, if I remember, right, Microsoft, guys, were, pretty, mad, at that time, am I misremembering, that, no, you're, not.

SPEAKER_00: Well, the thing, is, they, really, want, something, that, they, could, pitch, to companies, and, you know, like, um, just, you know, companies, use, Java, right, so, they, were, like, really, and, um, um, so, like, when, we, kind of, like, were, like, we, just, dropped, everything, and, just, focused, on, that, and, I remember, like, we, sort of, had, the internal, mantra, like, we, gotta, get, on stage, and, be, able, to write, adapt, in, like, 30 seconds, like, that, was, our, internal, magic, they, had, like, pre-announced, something, or, something, and, then, the Java guys, sort of, disappeared, or, something, yeah, they, preannounced, that, you know, they, were, going, to, show, like, the Java client, and, the Haskell client, and, we, were, like, this, we, were, like, the runner-up, like, they, were, like, I think, they, kind of, accepted, us, because, we, were, willing, to work, really, hard, and, the Java guys, got, like, I think, they, knew, that, they, needed, a backup.

SPEAKER_02: The other thing, I, I, remember, about Microsoft, is, that, there, was, a little bit, of, like, uh, um, uh, tension, within, there, because, there, were, the, they, were, just, launching, Azure, at that time, yeah, and, at the same time, they, had, blockchain, people, and, the blockchain, people, really, wanted, to focus, on, the blockchain, side, of it, and, the Azure, people, wanted, to, like, use, this, as a way, to, promote, uh, the new platform, so, so, there, was, always, a little bit, of friction, within.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, like, I remember, like, I think, the, you know, Marley Gray, was, really, driving, those efforts, inside Microsoft, at the time, and, they, were, like, they, were, like, really, really, pushing, it, and, I remember, like, they, were, trying, to get, people, in the room, to talk, to us, and, some, of them, weren't, even, I mean, it was, probably, like, you said, they, were, launching, Azure, so, that's, a huge project, I'm, sure, they, were, just, busy, with, other, stuff, but, we, spent, a lot, of time, in their, New York, office, I remember, we, were, like, going, there, all, the time.

SPEAKER_04: I'm, seeing, the Azure, launches, 2010, I checked, it, but, it, did, feel, much, more, nascent, than, it, is, today, like, Amazon, got, out, AWS, got, out, there, and, like, took, the whole, market, and, then, Azure, was, kind of, like, in, a catch-up, mode, but, I think, it, might've, even, like, exceeded, AWS, revenues, at some point, they, were, running, around, one, of the conferences, I, can't, remember, which, one, handing, out, free, passes, to everyone, it, was, that, conference, DEF CON 1, okay.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, they, were, they, were, handing, it, out, and, that's, why, they, wanted, to make, sure, we, were, on, their, Marketplace, so, like, they, could, hand, out, this, free, pass, and, you, could, get, the, you know, you, could, get, our, client, up, and, running, and, start, building, something, right, away, that, was, like, a revelation, to, a lot, of people, I remember, like, dozens, of companies, were, like, starting, in, that, first, week, their, devious, plan, worked, on, us, that, we, grabbed, a whole, bunch, of, free, uh, passes, and, then, a year, later, we, were, like, giving, them, like, ten thousand, dollars, a month, to stay, on, it, it, definitely, works, but, I guess, yeah, yeah, but, I don't, know, if, you, remember, like, that, the day, after, the Microsoft, announcement, there, was, a spike, in the price, and, we, were, like, hey, I think, we, actually, did, that, so, like, either, went, from, 20 cents, to, 30 cents.

SPEAKER_04: I think, we, just, did, the price, you mean, the Microsoft, stock, price, no, no, no, I meant, I think, it, was, both, actually, yeah, I think, they, both, went, up, and, we, were, like, hey, I think, we, actually, did, that, so, like, either, went, from, 20 cents, to, 30 cents, maybe, I think, it, was, like, a dollar, to, a dollar, 80, or, I, I, don't, remember, the price, check, it, out, but, it's, hard, to see, it's, funny, the price, range, is, like, so, yes, because, the price, is, oh, okay, so, it's, interesting, right, so, so, DevCon's, like, December, right, yeah, something, like, that, it's, around, a dollar, yeah, there, it, is, see, where, it, starts, taking, up, like, yeah, and, I think, we, definitely, got, calls, related, to, the Microsoft, announcement, into, January, yeah, for, sure.

SPEAKER_02: So, we, probably, had, something, to do, with, it, you, never, know, really, what's, causing, price, action, I'm, joking, but, I just, remember, sort, of, the mentality, within, was, that, until, it, was, up, to, $20, people, thought, it, was, a flop, and, somehow, when, it, hit, $20, everybody, around, me, all, of, a, sudden, got, really, excited, then.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, the average, person, buys, high, sells, low, that's, pretty, successful, it's, funny, and, it, was, still, low, um, okay, so, moving, along, kind, of, on, the back, of, the enterprise, announcement, uh, sorry, the Microsoft, announcement, we, started, to, get, customers, um, and, a lot, of, it, was, like, enterprises, that, were, fairly, early, in, their, journey, and, um, you know, wanted, just, some, advice, on, blockchain, technology, some, of, them, were, actually, ready, to, implement, something, I don't, know, Vic, you, took, a whole, lot, of, phone, calls, you, know, do, you, want, to, comment, on, any, of, that.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, it, was, kind, of, amazing, like, now, the numbers, in, relative, size, seem, pretty, small, but, in, the first, couple, months, we, went, from, zero, to, like, dozens, of, companies, calling, us, right, and, and, and, the amazing, thing, about, those, meetings, is, they, did, start, small, but, they, eventually, like, wound, up, to, be, um, like, 40, people, in, the room, like, all, the, major, clients, you know, like, all, of, these, things, because, I think, at, the time, um, really, where, the interest, was, in, terms, of, real-world, applications, of, the Ethereum, blockchain, was, in, the enterprise, space, like, they, were, willing, to, kind, of, make, investments, into, that, so, like, everyone, was, kind, of, participating, into, that, and, so, there, were, like, these, like, really, really, active, discussions, and, ultimately, we, just, kind, of, had, to, set, a line, in, the sand, um, and, make, a launch, basically, and, that, kind, of, led, to, it, launching, in, sort, of, early, 2017, but, you know, in, terms, of, time, frame, you, gotta, think, that, like, it, was, only, a little, over, a year, when, we, launched, with, a single, big, company, and, then, at, the launch, of EA, it, was, like, 40, companies, that, were, yeah, I remember, 28, or something, like, that, there, was, a logo, wall, that, was, nice, they, showed, you know, it, was, really, substantial, and, it, was, in, the Brooklyn, JPM, office, and, you know, like, it, was, like, a lot, of, big, players, and, this
