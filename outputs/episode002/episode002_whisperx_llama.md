**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** All right, well, welcome back everybody. Um, the first episode of the early days of Ethereum, I'm actually got quite good critical reception on LinkedIn and Twitter. I have a total of nine YouTube subscribers now, which I think is not so bad for a first video. Um, and there have been a few people who reached out who we've known a long time, who really appreciated the content. One of them called it, you know, essential viewing. So, anyway, we're back for another episode. So, remind everybody, I'm Kieran, James Levin, CEO of BlockApps, uh, here with my co-founders, Victor. Do you want to introduce yourself quickly? Oh, okay, I'm Victor Wong, um, co-founder and chief product officer of BlockApps. I'm James from OSD, hour, Jim, uh, CTO and founder, uh, co-founder of BlockApps. All right, thank you. Um, and so, I believe, where we left off, so I can't watch video of myself, so I forget exactly how we ended the last episode, but I believe we pretty much ended with the Ethereum launch, and there were some things we left out, even prior to launch, that we can kind of backtrack to a little bit, and then go forward to all of the kind of after-launch activity. So, with that said, maybe I'll hand it to Victor to talk about the first Consensus Dappathon, which was June 2015, I believe.

**[00:02] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so that was, I think, the first actual hackathon, building, you know, um, what we, what, in those days, were known as DApps, I guess some people still call it, but that seems to go now in favor with blockchain applications. So, the first idea was to really try to build um blockchain applications directly on Ethereum, and that was in the first Consensus office, which was like a very small co-working space in like Greenpoint, I think I would say it was water in, yeah, um, it was called Green Desks, maybe.

**[00:04] SPEAKER_01:** Green dust, yeah, that's right, yeah, it's right next to the modern-day Domino Park, uh, maybe a block away from there, or so, exactly, yeah, that's right. So, and it, of course, Domino Park did not exist at that time, in fact, Domino Park went up really quickly and took me by surprise, I like looked up one day, and there was like a big kind of well-manicured park there.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so, at that event, which was, I think, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say the concepts were really interesting. People were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer. And ConsenSys, at this point, was only like maybe 20 people at max, 20 or 30, yeah, that's interesting. It was really, really small, and you know, some great concepts came up, but like, even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that, uh, no one could build anything in a short period of time, like it was just impossible, like very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain, was kind of impossible, like you couldn't read the state off the blockchain, and all this kind of stuff. So, um, that kind of led into, yeah, like everything building in those days were incredibly hard, and that led into, so we decided, at that event, we were gonna, at the launch of Ethereum, we were going to do a bigger hackathon, and, um, that became the second Consensus Dappathon, which coincided with the launch of Ethereum, and it was us, um, you know, the Java client, which I think was called Ether Camp at that time, um, and like other tools that were kind of combined together, but what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger, like I think the first one, we had like six participants, the other one, we had like, I think, close to 30, and, um, but it introduced, like, a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly, like, what the winner was, a game, Fire App, like it really had that element of tokenized gameplay, there was a decentralized social app, I think, called Truther, or something, some something like that, and then, um, there was like a traceability supply chain app, in those early days, and that kind of all coincided, uh, with, like, the launch of Ethereum.

**[00:10] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, so, okay, in this, so, you're talking about the second one, I'm talking about the second one, yeah, the second one, also, the offices had shifted, so we had, um, um, our Consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of, at that time, uh, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, um, which is, uh, I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone, um, mostly remote, I remember, there was like a, there's like a horse lineage app, yeah, yeah, interesting, you know, um, and we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon, but that one was, uh, open to externals, right, so that was the big difference, and it actually was, you know, quite well-attended, um, the room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall, um, and you think that one was like 24 hours, or it was two days, I can't, I think it was two days, and, yeah, like the air conditioning thing.

**[00:12] SPEAKER_00:** So, we moved into that space to have the hackathon, like, you know, Consensus was playing, because they had outgrown that co-working space already, and so we moved into that space, which can, you know, was a reasonably sized room, like you could probably get 80 to 100 people in that room, right, but, yes, the air conditioning was terrible, and we had to frantically, um, we only realized this after we got into the room, so we had to, like, frantically buy some, and set them up.

**[00:14] SPEAKER_03:** Okay, I do have a memory of that.

**[00:15] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I don't know if you recall that, but, yeah, we were like trying to, like, get those air conditioning units in place before a ton of people showed up, because, yeah, like, we were sweating when there were only like five people in the room.

**[00:17] SPEAKER_03:** These were the scrappy days, in manually configuring air conditioning, I think the amount of furniture assembly that you do is a good proxy for how scrappy you are in your startup journey.

**[00:19] SPEAKER_00:** There was a lot of furniture, it was basically an empty room when we moved in there, and I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started, so we had to get everything up and running, and it was, this, to, like, sort of commemorate the launch, I think, or was it, like, right before the launch, it was, it was, it was right, it actually, you know, if, if you recall, at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be, like, this, the, the dates were always shifting, right, and we just said, we kind of arbitrarily chose, like, we wanted to, actually, synchronize it with the launch, but, because it was, because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was, and even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague, like, we're, like, exactly what actually happened, so we, we, have, at some point, had to arbitrarily choose the date, and they, they, more or less, what was the right date, like, I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

**[00:22] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, so, okay, in this, so, you're talking about the second one, I'm talking about the second one, yeah, the second one, also, the offices had shifted, so we had, um, um, our Consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of, at that time, uh, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, um, which is, uh, I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone, um, mostly remote, I remember, there was like a, there's like a horse lineage app, yeah, yeah, interesting, you know, um, and we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon, but that one was, uh, open to externals, right, so that was the big difference, and it actually was, you know, quite well-attended, um, the room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall, um, and you think that one was like 24 hours, or it was two days, I can't, I think it was two days, and, yeah, like the air conditioning thing.

**[00:24] SPEAKER_00:** So, at that event, which was, I think, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say the concepts were really interesting, people were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer, and ConsenSys, at this point, was only like maybe 20 people at max, 20 or 30, yeah, that's interesting, it was really, really small, and you know, some great concepts came up, but like, even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that, uh, no one could build anything in a short period of time, like it was just impossible, like very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain, was kind of impossible, like you couldn't read the state off the blockchain, and all this kind of stuff, so, um, that kind of led into, yeah, like everything building in those days were incredibly hard, and that led into, so we decided, at that event, we were gonna, at the launch of Ethereum, we were going to do a bigger hackathon, and, um, that became the second Consensus Dappathon, which coincided with the launch of Ethereum, and it was us, um, you know, the Java client, which I think was called Ether Camp at that time, um, and like other tools that were kind of combined together, but what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger, like I think the first one, we had like six participants, the other one, we had like, I think, close to 30, and, um, but it introduced, like, a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly, like, what the winner was, a game, Fire App, like it really had that element of tokenized gameplay, there was a decentralized social app, I think, called Truther, or something, some something like that, and then, um, there was like a traceability supply chain app, in those early days, and that kind of all coincided, uh, with, like, the launch of Ethereum.

**[00:28] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, so, okay, in this, so, you're talking about the second one, I'm talking about the second one, yeah, the second one, also, the offices had shifted, so we had, um, um, our Consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of, at that time, uh, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, um, which is, uh, I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone, um, mostly remote, I remember, there was like a, there's like a horse lineage app, yeah, yeah, interesting, you know, um, and we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon, but that one was, uh, open to externals, right, so that was the big difference, and it actually was, you know, quite well-attended, um, the room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall, um, and you think that one was like 24 hours, or it was two days, I can't, I think it was two days, and, yeah, like the air conditioning thing.

**[00:35] SPEAKER_03:** These were the scrappy days, in manually configuring air conditioning, I think the amount of furniture assembly that you do is a good proxy for how scrappy you are in your startup journey.

**[00:37] SPEAKER_00:** There was a lot of furniture, it was basically an empty room when we moved in there, and I think we moved in there a day or two before the hackathon actually started, so we had to get everything up and running, and it was, this, to, like, sort of commemorate the launch, I think, or was it, like, right before the launch, it was, it was, it was right, it actually, you know, if, if you recall, at the time, we didn't know when the launch would be, like, this, the, the dates were always shifting, right, and we just said, we kind of arbitrarily chose, like, we wanted to, actually, synchronize it with the launch, but, because it was, because we couldn't know exactly when the launch was, and even when they declared the date, it was still a little bit vague, like, we're, like, exactly what actually happened, so we, we, have, at some point, had to arbitrarily choose the date, and they, they, more or less, what was the right date, like, I think it was off by maybe a day or two.

**[00:40] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, so, okay, in this, so, you're talking about the second one, I'm talking about the second one, yeah, the second one, also, the offices had shifted, so we had, um, um, our Consensus, which we were kind of working as a part of, at that time, uh, had moved to a much larger office in Bushwick, um, which is, uh, I believe they still have a presence there, though they've gone, um, mostly remote, I remember, there was like a, there's like a horse lineage app, yeah, yeah, interesting, you know, um, and we ended up actually hiring a couple people who participated in the hackathon, but that one was, uh, open to externals, right, so that was the big difference, and it actually was, you know, quite well-attended, um, the room, I think, never had the greatest air conditioning, but it was really quite hot in there, if I recall, um, and you think that one was like 24 hours, or it was two days, I can't, I think it was two days, and, yeah, like the air conditioning thing.

**[00:42] SPEAKER_00:** So, at that event, which was, I think, two to three months before the actual launch of Ethereum, I will say the concepts were really interesting, people were coming up, and it was mostly, I think, interns that were interning at ConsenSys over that summer, and ConsenSys, at this point, was only like maybe 20 people at max, 20 or 30, yeah, that's interesting, it was really, really small, and you know, some great concepts came up, but like, even with the stuff we built, we realized pretty quickly that, uh, no one could build anything in a short period of time, like it was just impossible, like very basic stuff, like reading a variable off the blockchain, was kind of impossible, like you couldn't read the state off the blockchain, and all this kind of stuff, so, um, that kind of led into, yeah, like everything building in those days were incredibly hard, and that led into, so we decided, at that event, we were gonna, at the launch of Ethereum, we were going to do a bigger hackathon, and, um, that became the second Consensus Dappathon, which coincided with the launch of Ethereum, and it was us, um, you know, the Java client, which I think was called Ether Camp at that time, um, and like other tools that were kind of combined together, but what was really interesting about that one was, you know, it was bigger, like I think the first one, we had like six participants, the other one, we had like, I think, close to 30, and, um, but it introduced, like, a lot of ideas that would become more developed pretty quickly, like, what the winner was, a game, Fire App, like it really had that element of tokenized gameplay, there was a decentralized social app, I think, called Truther, or something, some something like that, and then, um, there was like a traceability supply chain app, in those early days, and that kind of all coincided, uh, with, like, the launch of Ethereum.

**[00:45] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, so, Jim, I might have asked you this last episode, but I'll ask again, do you remember, one, trying to predict the launch, and could you explain how, and two, there was some complicated mechanism for how the launch would actually happen, because it's hard for, like, a decentralized group to decide on a launch time, I can't remember that at all.

**[00:47] SPEAKER_01:** You were mentioning it in the last video, and I didn't remember this, but I don't doubt it, it sounds correct, you were saying we were looking through the Git commits at the time.

**[00:49] SPEAKER_03:** We were, yes, you made this plot, it was like commits by day, and as the commits, and you extrapolated it for it, I think it probably got within a couple of days of the launch date, okay, so I have to, yeah, I still don't know how they, like, set the clock on the first block, so to speak, maybe we can, like, dig this up, there was something they did, um, and that we had probably in our DMs, I, I, wish I thought to look between the first and second video to find the actual discussion that we had, maybe the graph is in there, yeah, yeah, that's very funny, the Slack is the treasure trove of, uh, interesting things, um, all right, uh, so, yeah, so it launched, um, and I kind of felt like there was a sort of, and then what, going on, you know, it took a little time for things to get going, and then, you know, this, it, obviously, it's been a smashing success, right, it's just sort of the reality of a new platform, you sort of get it out there, you see what people do, you learn from it, and it took a minute for the activity to kick in.

**[00:53] SPEAKER_01:** I remember a lot of people around us at the time had been buying a lot of presale Ether beforehand, and so the day it came out, I think they were expecting it to have a huge jump in value immediately, and when, when, like, a couple weeks had gone by, and it was only, uh, still like 20 cents in Ether, so I remember people around us were kind of like, some of the people there were like, oh, this thing was a flop, it's never gonna go anywhere, yeah, yeah.

**[00:55] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, it's just psychologically, yeah, the expectations were super high, there was this concept floating on Consensus of day one DApps, like, yeah, I had to be ready, right, for the launch, because, you know, it was a land grab, and things were going to the moon, and you know, it turned out, you know, not quite, obviously, again, smashing success, but, yeah, the price was like under a dollar for a little bit, and then around a dollar for, like, a while, I believe, um, and I did want to mention, so, um, I, I, had to look this up, so the first, ICO, whatever you want to call it, that was on Ethereum, obviously, Ethereum did its own crowd sale, um, but it was, like, uh, you know, they took in Bitcoin, and there was, it was something like two thousand Ether to one Bitcoin at the time, which I believe, at the time, was like 20 or 30 cents, and then it had gone up to a dollar on launch, which is already a pretty good return, you know, but, that is what it is, the first ICO, apparently, was Augur, and I knew the Augur guys a little bit, I was digging through the CryptoEconomicon videos, I believe one or two of them presented, or ran panels, at CryptoEconomicon, for folks who are listening to this, CryptoEconomicon was a conference that we had in January 2015, that involved a lot of the people who then, including, metallic, and some of the other Ethereum folks, um, then subsequently created, really big and interesting, mostly layer one projects, in the Ethereum space, but others as well, so, the videos are actually up, I tweeted a couple of them, but there was, apparently, I think I created a YouTube channel, like, in 2015, and uploaded all those, I definitely remember getting them recorded, so, check those out, if that's of interest, so, Augur was the first, I guess, of the prediction markets platforms, there have since been a couple of new ones, that have popped up, that seem to be popular, there was also this, sort of, competing project, called Truthcoin, um, and, I, was kind of confused about how the two related to each other, um, I think there was no formal relation, though, I remember meeting up, there's getting Matt Liston, I met, who, I checked his LinkedIn, he's been, a different couple, different places, so, I think Augur, uh, maybe we should look up, who actually founded Augur, so, Jeremy Gardner, I, you know, I've known, over the years, and he, I met him, in San Francisco, with Vitalik, because, metallic, was staying at, what was, uh, turned, at the time, the Crypto Castle, um, and, you know, it's kind of, what you would imagine, sort of, like a co-working, co-living, um, crypto space, for, and, not everyone there was working on Augur, they're all working on different things, it's kind of, common, uh, thing to do, well, I, I, think, if you hear the term Crypto Castle, now, people would imagine, an actual castle, say, you know, what you're describing, which is more like a dormitory, yes, it was more like a dorm, I mean, it was a nice, nice little house, I think, I, can't remember, it might have been, like, adjacent to the mission, in, San Francisco, um, and, so, Vitalik, would stay there, sometimes, Joey Krug, I've probably met, two or three times, over the years, I'm not even sure, if I ever met, Jack Peterson, so, those are the three founders of Augur, so, I guess, they were good friends with Vitalik, or just, sort of, had realized, early on, that, it would be easier to develop on Ethereum, than it would be to try to do something with Bitcoin, which was, kind of, the predominant suggestion, at the time, but, they did, the first, on Ethereum, um, um, crowdfund, um, like, I guess, right after launch, the Wikipedia, is saying, August 2015, um, which is really, really early, I don't know, if I believe, this Wikipedia page, it says, soon after the platform launched, users had created, the death pools, or assassination markets, on famous people, so, back in 2015, every discussion, about blockchain, Justin Delacruz, Ph.D., eventually, led to, both, prediction markets, and then, this, sort of, uncensored ability, you can't shut it down, would lead, then, to assassination markets, um, assassination markets, being, you predict, you bet, on the day, someone dies, you know, and then, someone takes the other side, of that bet, Justin Delacruz, kills them, and collects, on it, so, apparently, they're, actually, were, assassination markets, created, on, Otter, according to, this Wikipedia page, I'm, yeah, I have to look into that, I'm, a little bit, dubious, but, in any case, um, yeah, so, Augur, then, blazed the trail, sort of, after, Ethereum, did, with, a successful crowd sale, um, for, the wave, of ICOs, that, that, came later, um, but, yeah, so, Truthcoin, was, also, this, sort of, competing project, I just, remember, meeting up, with Matt, at, like, a Berkeley coffee shop, and talking, about, both, Augur, and Truthcoin, had, some, sort of, David Price, you know, machine learning, slightly, like, computer science, graph theoretic, way, of, like, determining, what the truth was, so, like, you take, a bunch of votes, from, a bunch of people, but, then, determine, the principal components, of, how the voting, is, an extract, the truth, from there, it was, sounded, like, very, you know, high-end math, mechanistic, which, it was, very common, of the space, every, like, you know, the crypto, has, a lot of these, like, mathematician types, who, like, kind of, came in, and wanted to create, like, really complicated schemes, and mechanisms, and all that, sort of, stuff, that, had, provable, theoretical properties, for, something, interesting, about, you know, this, space, but, yeah, I'm, so, so, they, must have launched, it, like, right away, that's, very interesting, I remember, us, talking, to them, at some point, and they were, developing, that, like, they, did, want to be, a day one DApp, I remember, and they were, I think, the platform, went live, 2018, the Wikipedia page says, but, they, did, the crowd sale, like, basically, right away, right, right, yeah, um, so, should we go on, to DevCon 1, which, I guess, I can talk about, so, kind of, concurrently, while, all, this, is happening, we started to work, a bunch, so, ConsenSys, had, a business development team, a little bit, of a mix, uh, marketing, BD, actual sales, you know, Etc, that, um, was starting to generate interest, from big companies, in the technology, so, um, you know, uh, for us, ourselves, we definitely, worked, with companies, far more, than, sort of, the crypto public, for, you know, most of the history, of the company, um, still, don't, really, work, with, the crypto public, today, um, but, you know, ConsenSys, was, kind of, conflicted, on this front, so, they, you know, what, they, they, had, sort of, pure blockchain, native project, and, eventually, in big numbers, they, also, had, an enterprise arm, which, is, really, more, consulting, oriented, although, they, kind of, ended up, sort of, backfilling, what, they, saw, demand, for, with, products, at times, but, in any case, the BD folks, were reaching out, to everybody, and, they, actually, got, a fair bit, of interest, from Microsoft, and, I think, Microsoft, had, already, been, kind of, watching, the Ethereum, revolution, and, seeing, it, as, something, interesting, the new front, of the cloud war, perhaps, and, so, you know, we got, to, working, with them, and, so, maybe, for, the technical part, of this, I could, kind of, transition, but, basically, so, ConsenSys, had, a couple, you know, preferred projects, which, had, the low-level, you know, like, low-level, I mean, like, the blockchain, client, itself, infrastructure, that, could, be, deployed, on cloud platforms, and, maybe, yeah, so, that, ended up, being, basically, us, and, the, you know, the Java folks, um, Vic, do you want, to take, any, of that?

**[01:05] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, sure, so, they, were, interested, in, kind of, being, able, to, deploy, one, of the clients, that, we, had, we, had, the Haskell client, and, then, the Java folks, they, were, actually, more, interested, in, the Java folks, wait, I should, take, a step back, here, just, mentioning, that, DevCon 1, almost, didn't, happen, if, you recall, right, because, it, was, in, this, low, period, and, the Ethereum, foundation, was, kind of, running, out, of, money, because, you know, this, is, why, the launch, had, to, happen, when, it, happened, and, in, that, low, period, they, were, like, you, know, still, trying, to, preserve, a, lot, of, cash, and, so, it, almost, didn't, happen, and, I, remember, like, a, lot, of, people, inside, ConsenSys, were, like, no, like, we, have, to, like, bring, this, to, kind, of, bring, this, up, and, make, an, event, out, of, this, you, know, like, I, think, Andrew, Keys, was, leading, the, charge, in, that, really, saying, like, we, got, to, do, this, and, then, this, Microsoft, thing, kind, of, bundled, into, that, right, so, it, was, us, and, the, Java client, and, my, background, was, like, you, know, in, my, previous, company, I, had, tried, to, work, with, Microsoft, and, building, apps, like, when, they, had, their, first, mobile, platform, and, it, took, me, like, six, months, to, get, a, meeting, and, I, had, a, cousin, who, was, like, a, VP, at, Microsoft, so, it, was, amazing, to, me, that, they, were, just, coming, to, us, and, they, wanted, to, launch, something, with, us, in, two, months, and, I, think, at, that, point, we, decided, okay, this, is, a, huge, opportunity, we're, going, to, drop, everything, and, focus, on, that, launch, which, turned, out, to, be, launching, blockchain, as, a, service, but, oddly, enough, the Java, guys, started, and, then, they, just, kind, of, faded, away, they, weren't, really, interested, in, kind, of, pursuing, it, they, just, had, other, things, going, on, so, we, went, over, it, so, by, the, time, DevCon 1, happened, the, only, thing, that, was, working, was, our, client, it, was, ready, on, the, cloud, you, could, download, it, and, you, could, start, building, on, it, right, away, and, then, remember, we, started, to, get, downloads, immediately, people, started, to, get, people, using, it, immediately, but, that's, also, in, that, run, up, that, was, when, we, realized, when, Microsoft, realized, if, we're, going, to, make, this, as, a, developer, tool, it, can't, connect, to, the, public, Ethereum, network, because, people, wouldn't, be, able, to, get, Ether, like, it, was, quite, hard, to, get, Ether, at, that, point, there, weren't, really, that, many, exchanges, or, anything, to, go, on, so, we, were, that's, kind, of, how, we, kind, of, created, like, private, Ethereum, you, know, and, private, Enterprise, what, what, became, known, as, private, if, they, were, more, Enterprise, up, here, so.

**[01:10] SPEAKER_03:** That, that, kind, of, all, led, up, and, then, the, launch, itself, in, London, um, when, we, got, up, with, Microsoft, I, think, people, were, shocked, that, Microsoft, was, into, it, you, know, so, uh, I, just, looked, that, up, and, didn't, have, in, our, little, outline, but, I, I, had, forgotten, about, this, so, I, think, Coinbase, listed, Ether, like, mid, 2016, right, I'm, seeing, May, 24th, 2016.

**[01:12] SPEAKER_00:** So, and, I, I, guess, like, Kraken, was, the, popular, exchange, at, the, time, you, know, I, think, it, was, Poloniex, I'm, sorry, you're, right, yeah, Poloniex, still, exists, and, I, just, remember, there, was, like, the, chat, function, on, Poloniex, and, like, man, like, that, was, like, crazy, like, that, was, Discord, before, there, was, Discord.

**[01:14] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, wait, hold, on, Circle, bought, it, maybe, and, then, it, seems, to, have, shut, it, down, anyway, I'm, confused, by,
