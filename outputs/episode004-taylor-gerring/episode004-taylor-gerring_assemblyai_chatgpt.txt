SPEAKER_00: That little flub.

SPEAKER_01: Fantastic.

SPEAKER_02: All here. Hello.

SPEAKER_03: Hello.

SPEAKER_02: We are back.

SPEAKER_00: Great.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you know, technical difficulties, I suppose it's common. I think we wanted to start at 5:05 and so we are doing well on time. Thanks for everyone for jumping over. Just a friendly reminder, just throw any questions within the Twitter thread. I'll be keeping an eye on those. Hey Mike, thanks Yum for posting both. Two great comments in the thread and then yeah, like, share, repost. Got a great space ahead and then with that I guess we can get started and I'll pass it over to Bob to introduce the speakers.

SPEAKER_00: So hi, welcome everyone. So yeah, really happy to have Taylor Gerring here as a guest. Back in late 2023, Kieran, Victor and Jim did a couple of videos on the early days of Ethereum, which I absolutely loved being an Ethereum history buff as I am, and I made a whole load of notes on those sufficient that they invited me on as a guest on the third edition. And I made a bunch of notes on that again. So we were talking through our own experiences from 2014 onwards to around late 2017 there. But yeah, just thought, especially with the 10th anniversary, that it would be great to have an OG on to talk about the early days and you don't get a lot more OG than Taylor. So welcome Taylor. Hello.

SPEAKER_03: Hello everybody. And thank you very much for that kind introduction, Bob. And appreciate everybody. I'm honored to join you guys and maybe add a little bit to the story, fill in some gaps in the history that people might be wondering and do whatever I can do to get some chuckles out of the audience.

SPEAKER_02: So.

SPEAKER_00: So Taylor, do tell us something about yourself in general, like where are you from? You know, what did your early years look like before you got involved in this nonsense?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, sure. So I'm actually sitting in the town I was born in in South Florida where I was raised in. Probably spent the first 20 years of my life or so, a few more than that. I knew already way back when that I was super good with computers and kind of entered college, university with the intention of getting a degree in that realm. And that's what I did. I went to junior college first and then I finished my degree up in Orlando. It was Management of Information Systems. And the way I describe it is half business, half computers. And that turned out to be a fantastic skill set to kind of bring to the early days of Ethereum. You know, when it's just startup mode, things are just flying left, right, up, down, forward, every single direction. And there's not a lot of people paying attention to kind of how the business is supposed to work and be organized. I thought that gave me a little bit of a leg up going in, understanding that we're gonna have to submit receipts for things and they're gonna have to be accounted for. And so I was a little more diligent with my early days activities because of that experience. But yeah, I left there to go to Chicago and got a lot of great experience in the companies and organizations that I worked with up until the point where honestly I got tired of working with proprietary software, you know, from predominantly Microsoft houses. And I started shifting back towards open source software. Kind of thinking back to when I first got started, I was doing like PHP, MySQL and found me at the right place, right time to discover and learn about Bitcoin and really fall into the whole world of open source, decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain software. So I just feel like it was opportunity and luck meeting. You know, I was prepared for the right thing. I was in the right time, right place kind of situation and tried to stay positioned there. And that way I could bring all my skill sets to a project that I was very passionate about.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, were you like a, you know, a libertarian, a cypherpunk, a gold bug, a prepper, any of that kind of flavor?

SPEAKER_03: You know, honestly I kind of had a little bit of a heads up about politics and the whole left versus right thing and trying to step away from that. But I had not really gotten into the super libertarian stuff. I wasn't really a precious metal guy. It was really once I discovered Bitcoin and really understood it and those principles that we all kind of take to heart once we finally join the cult. Really stumbling upon Bitcoin is when I most embraced those kind of ideals, if you will, and certainly hold a lot of those still close to me today. Even though it feels like as a whole industry or whatever, we're kind of out of practice. A lot of people just don't really think about the decentralization side. But that is definitely part of what drew me in was the idea that it wasn't controlled and that we all are contributing and even some more esoteric ideas like living in Holland, like alternative communities and stuff. I'm fascinated by all that stuff. But I recognize there's some practical limitations with modern society on making that work.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, how long were you a Bitcoiner before you heard about Ethereum?

SPEAKER_03: I discovered Bitcoin I want to say in 2011. When I was clearing off a laptop I saw I had the Bitcoin software downloaded but it was still in testnet mode. I never figured out how to get it out of testnet mode until when I really discovered it the second time in 2012 and going into 2013. That continued working through 2013, doing some mining, trying to join various aspects of Bitcoin projects, writing about different alternative projects like Namecoin, Bitmessage and stuff. And then I guess it would have been towards the end of that year was when I met Mihai Alisie in Milan, Italy. I think that was late 2013. And then Vitalik ended up giving his talk in Miami to announce Ethereum officially in 2014. So I guess maybe it was just over a year that I was like a pretty die-hard Bitcoiner and then just feeling like there's more to this whole blockchain technology and observing what everybody was trying to do with alternative things. Like I said, Namecoin was one of those, like using blockchains for name resolution services. I saw the writing on the wall that there was something else to do with Bitcoin and I just didn't know what it was until I finally read Vitalik's paper three times. And it kind of clicked in my head that, ah, here's the way forward.

SPEAKER_00: And you were working for some wallet company or involved with a wallet project when you were in Miami there?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. So I think at the time I wrote in on the Bitcoin dev mailing list about trying to figure out can we do a slider, like just normal UI slider that we use all the time for volume and whatever to adjust the fees and stuff for Bitcoin. And that was at the behest of Wendell Davis who ran a software company making Hive Bitcoin Wallet. It was supposed to be something super secure, simple enough for like your parents to use. I think it had Tor network built in by default. And he had taken an interest in some of the projects I was working on on top of Bitcoin. So probably most people don't know but the first project I wrote, if you go on GitHub, there's a project called PayThru, P-A-Y-T-H-R-U. And the idea was can I pay Bitcoin to people who haven't necessarily set up a Bitcoin address yet. So for example, tipping on Twitter, tipping somebody's website, things of that nature. And so I kind of came up with a little system where it would generate an address to send the funds to if that person didn't have something pre-registered. And I had a mechanism in place where if the person then, for example, put their Bitcoin address in their Twitter handle profile or whatever, it could go scan that and it would pull that address out of there and then take the funds from the temporary address and forward them over to the more permanent one. So it was kind of like a way to hold the funds and then if you had an account and you're like, oh, I want to collect my tips, all I got to do is put my own Bitcoin address on my website or on my Twitter profile and then you could receive those funds without having to really do very much. I thought it was kind of an ingenious system. Some people didn't like it because of the technicalities of how Bitcoin has addresses and return addresses are not always return addresses. But I think it was novel and interesting enough that Wendell saw the value that I could bring and my skill set to Hive Bitcoin Wallet. And so I started working on that kind of, I guess it was like a very rudimentary DApp sort of interface. The wallet could have plugin sort of things where you could click on the DApp sort of thing. And because you're loading it in your own wallet, it already knows what your receiving address is. So it made it easy to go to a website and interact with various services with knowing already some of your crypto information. So I started working on plugins and things of that nature, making them refined. But once I learned about Ethereum, I found it really, really hard to want to keep working on the Mac-only wallet because I just saw the impact of working on something that wasn't just focused on one platform, let's say.

SPEAKER_00: Gotcha.

SPEAKER_03: So Wendell was very instrumental in kind of informing—like encouraging me, I guess is a better word—to go out and travel a little bit more and just be a nomad, living out of my backpack. And it was because of that that I ended up going to Milan and meeting Mihai. And Mihai is the one who ended up connecting me to Vitalik and the rest of the team. So Wendell's definitely an instrumental part of my story with Ethereum.

SPEAKER_00: Nice. Yeah, he's a bit of a mystery man, isn't he?

SPEAKER_03: Last I heard he was in Thailand, I think with a wife. I don't know if he was having kids or whatever, but he kind of fell off the face of the earth to me. I haven't heard from him in many, many years.

SPEAKER_00: No, he was at Devcon doing a talk about grants actually, and I got my name on the screen. I didn't get to go to London, but I was on the screen as a named contributor to Eth Embedded. But yeah, I didn't see him around in Ethereum land much beyond that kind of timeline.

SPEAKER_03: There's a lot of that though. A lot of people have, you know, they put in their contribution and they go attend to other aspects of life.

SPEAKER_01: Right.

SPEAKER_03: Life isn't just about working on startups. I mean, some people want to have families and stuff. So, you know, there's a lot of people who have done their thing and gone off to greener pastures, whatever that means for them, and no hard feelings to any of those. I mean, I find myself in a similar space where I'm not contributing like I once was and trying to enjoy other facets of life, but I think it's just part of the natural cycle of things.
