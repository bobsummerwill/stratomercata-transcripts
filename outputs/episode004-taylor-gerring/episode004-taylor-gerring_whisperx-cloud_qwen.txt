SPEAKER_00: that little love. Fantastic. All here. Hello. Hello. We are back. Great. Yeah. Uh, you know, technical difficulties, uh, I suppose it's common. I think we wanted to start at five Oh five. And, uh, so we are doing well on time. Thanks for everyone for jumping over. Um, Just a friendly reminder, just throw any questions within the Twitter thread. I'll be keeping an eye on those. Hey, Mike. Thanks, Yum, for posting both two great comments in the thread. And then, yeah, like, share, repost. Got a great space ahead. And then with that, I guess we can get started, and I'll pass it over to Bob to introduce the speakers.

SPEAKER_03: So, hi. Welcome, everyone. So, yeah, really happy to have Taylor Garing here as a guest. Back in late 2023, Kieran Victor and Jim did a couple of videos on the early days of Ethereum, which I absolutely loved, being an Ethereum history buff as I am. And I made a whole load of notes on those, sufficient that they invited me on as a guest on the third edition. And I made a bunch of notes on that again. So we were talking through our own experiences from 2014 onwards to around late 2017 then. But yeah, just thought, especially with the 10th anniversary, that it would be great to have

SPEAKER_01: an OG on to talk about the early days and you don't get a lot more OG than Taylor. So welcome, Taylor. Hello. Hello, everybody. And thank you very much for that kind introduction, Bob, and appreciate everybody. I'm honored to join you guys and maybe add a little bit to the story, fill in some gaps in the history that people might be wondering and do whatever I can do to get some chuckles out of the audience.

SPEAKER_03: So, Taylor, do tell us something about yourself in general. Where are you from? What did your early years look like before you got involved in this nonsense? Yeah, sure. So I'm actually sitting in the town I was born in, in South Florida, where I was raised.

SPEAKER_01: probably spent the first 20 years of my life or so, a few more than that. I knew already way back when that I was super good with computers and kind of entered college, university with the intention of like getting a degree in that realm. And that's what I did. I went to junior college first and then I finished my degree up in Orlando. was management of information systems. And the way I describe it is half business, half computers. And that turned out to be a fantastic skillset to kind of bring to the early days of Ethereum. You know, when it's just startup mode, things are just flying left, right, up, down, forward, every single direction. And there's not a lot of people paying attention to kind of how the business is supposed to work and be organized. And I thought that gave me a little bit of a leg up going in, understanding that we're going to have to submit receipts for things and they're going to have to be accounted for. And so I was a little more diligent with my early days activities because of that experience. But yeah, I left there to go to Chicago and got a lot of great experience in the companies and organizations I worked with up until the point where Honestly, I got tired of working with proprietary software, you know, from predominantly Microsoft houses. And I sort of moved shifting back towards open source software, kind of thinking back to when I first got started, I was doing like PHP, MySQL. and uh found me at the right place right time to discover and learn about bitcoin and uh really fall into the whole world of open source decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain software so i just feel like i was a opportunity and uh luck meeting you know i was like I had, I was prepared for the right thing. I was in the right time, right place kind of situation and try to stay positioned there. And that way I could bring all my skill sets to a project that I was very passionate about.

SPEAKER_03: So, Taylor, do you have any background in libertarianism or cypherpunk culture? You know, honestly, I, uh, I kind of had a little bit of a heads up about politics and. Uh, the whole left versus right, right thing and trying to, um, step away from that. But I had not really gotten into the super libertarian stuff. I wasn't really a precious metal guy. Uh, it was really, once I discovered Bitcoin and really understood it and those principles that we all kind of take to heart, once we finally joined the cult, um, Really stumbling upon Bitcoin is when I most embrace those kind of ideals, if you will, and certainly hold a lot of those still close to me today, even though it feels like as a whole industry or whatever, we're kind of out of practice. A lot of people just don't really think about the decentralization side, but that is definitely part of what what drew me in was the idea that wasn't controlled and that we all are contributing and um even some more esoteric ideas like living in uh Hollands um like alternative communities and stuff I'm I'm fascinated by all that stuff but I recognize there's some practical limitations with modern society on making that work yeah yeah so i mean how long were you a bitcoiner before you heard about ethereum I discovered Bitcoin, I want to say in 2011. When I was clearing off a laptop, I... So I had the Bitcoin software downloaded, but it was still in testnet mode. I never figured out how to get out of testnet mode until when I really discovered the second time in 2012 and going into 2013. Then I continued working through 2013, doing some mining, trying to join various aspects of Bitcoin projects, writing about different alternative projects like Namecoin, Bitmessage and stuff. And then I guess it would have been towards the end of that year was when I met Mihaly Lissier in Milan, Italy. I think that was late 2013. And then Vitalik ended up giving his talk in Miami to announce Ethereum officially in 2014. So I guess maybe it was just over a year that I was like a pretty diehard Bitcoiner.

SPEAKER_01: so uh but yeah i didn't see him around in ethereum land much much beyond that kind of time line there there's a lot of that though a lot of people have uh you know they put in their contribution and they go attend to other aspects of life right life isn't just working about working on startups i mean uh some people want to have families and stuff so yeah There's a lot of people who have done their thing and gone off to greener pastures, whatever that means for them. And no hard feelings to any of those. I mean, I find myself in a similar space where I'm not contributing like I once was and trying to enjoy other facets of life. But I think it's just part of the natural cycle of things.

SPEAKER_03: Last I heard, he was in Thailand, I think with a wife. I don't know if he was having kids or whatever, but he kind of fell off the face of the earth to me. I haven't heard from him in many, many years.

SPEAKER_01: Nice. Yeah, he's a bit of a mystery man, isn't he? Last I heard, he was in Thailand, I think with a wife. I don't know if he was having kids or whatever, but he kind of fell off the face of the earth to me. I haven't heard from him in many, many years.

SPEAKER_03: Nice. Yeah, he's a bit of a mystery man, isn't he? Last I heard, he was in Thailand, I think with a wife. I don't know if he was having kids or whatever, but he kind of fell off the face of the earth to me. I haven't heard from him in many, many years.

SPEAKER_01: so uh but yeah i didn't see him around in ethereum land much much beyond that kind of time line there there's a lot of that though a lot of people have uh you know they put in their contribution and they go attend to other aspects of life right life isn't just working about working on startups i mean uh some people want to have families and stuff so yeah There's a lot of people who have done their thing and gone off to greener pastures, whatever that means for them.

SPEAKER_02: I just felt like documenting as much as I could while I was there was like. The way to do it, because everybody was just living in the moment. We, um, Bob's audio was glitching for a little bit and now he's muted again. Um, can everyone hear me? Oh, I'm back. Okay. Yeah. What happened that?

SPEAKER_01: A little nerve wracking for a shy computer nerd to just meet up with a bunch of randos and now it's kind of there with Wendell and his group. And then he had told us about these other people that rented a house. And I don't think any of us had sorted rooms or figured out where we're staying and it was kind of like just turning into a crash space. I didn't know hardly anybody and I was keeping to myself a lot, but it did turn out to be a very important time and place to be in the historical story of Ethereum. There were the vast majority of, I'd say, some of the earliest people that had huge influences on Ethereum's eventual launch. A lot of those people got together physically for the first time there. I believe Jeff Wilkie was not able to go. But a lot of the other Europeans came over stateside for that. And that was the first time that I met and sat down with Vitalik and we started working on some of the very basic ideas of what the website crowd sale sort of situation would need be, although that all eventually changed.

SPEAKER_03: nice yeah saying with that iconic photograph i can't remember the guy's name now but at some point i i met the guy who's who had the speaking slot after vitalik and he said and everyone just started off it's like nobody left in the room for him that's that's got to be a tough act to follow you know yeah so so yeah saying about a great number of photos from January, March through July of 2014. So if you look on my Twitter thread from yesterday, I linked to some of those. It was a really interesting time. I don't think anybody really knew what was going on.

SPEAKER_01: Um, yeah, I was just saying on that, on that thread, on the, on the photo thread that you got tailored, there was that sort of iconic, everyone crowding around, um, Vitalik, uh, yeah, with Anthony and, uh, and Joe there, and then some photos on your, on the back patio. And then there's that group shot, uh, with everyone there and, uh, and some other bits and pieces. So, so yeah, it's saying February the 9th was a day that we arrived in

SPEAKER_01: Europe. So that's where the Zoog adventure began, early February. Yeah, it would be interesting to go back and check the actual timeline. I felt like things happened kind of fast. The where we landed in in zug was uh i mean landed in zurich but then we took the train to a small farm town called meyer's couple and uh there was a handful group there that was just staying in an airbnb and i i went along with uh my friend nick fiero who kind of came with me we met up in i think germany somewhere and continued on to zurich but we landed there and it was just uh very chaotic in the sense that nobody had a good sense of what was happening on what timeline for what reason You know, whether it was just sleeping quarters or getting the website online or who was arriving, it was just constant chaos. But if I remember correctly, Charles came in the next day or two pretty soon thereafter. And then the house eventually filled up with Ian Meikle, who did all the artwork. And oh, gosh, I can't remember his buddy. Richard Wilde.

SPEAKER_03: Richard Wilde. That's right. Richard was actually the first one who was introduced to the project. He brought Ian along, and I think Ian ended up sticking around longer. Yeah. Though he wasn't originally called Wilde. Funny little tidbit. That's actually his wife's surname that he took when they got married. I forget her name, though.

SPEAKER_01: Really? Yep. I guess he liked Wilde. It sounded cool. I just assumed it was a pseudonymous name that he had picked and changed or something like that. It could have been, but yeah, I believe she had, he, he, he had a different name before her name, Jane, Jane Wild. Perhaps it was a pseudonym for them both. Who knows? At that point, were other people like working together in other parts of the world? Have you got people together in, uh,

SPEAKER_01: you know, in London or New York as well at that point? Unbeknownst to me, I thought Zoom in Switzerland was kind of ground zero. And I think from a legal standpoint, that was probably true. But certainly from a code standpoint, it was not the case. And that, you know, led to some schisms down the road of like, the funny thing is like game of thrones was premiering every sunday uh while like ethereum's developing and uh switzerland was just like turned out to be one of the hubs right there was also berlin and london and amsterdam and toronto arguably and uh so it was like took a little bit of time but It started to become apparent there was definitely a Game of Thrones being played in many different ways. I think we were all very naive in the earliest of days. But as we're trying to get money to get into a permanent house, like what was called the spaceship, I started to feel some of the struggles and pains of like, hey, there's a bunch of other groups and everybody's vying for resources at this time. And then you start to get to deal with some of the other personalities. One of the things I, one of the fun stories I remember is dealing with the Germans and having to accept that, you know, Germans just talk in a certain way and it's not meant as like an offense. It's just how they speak. And you have to kind of just roll with that a little more purse, if you will. But being introduced to everybody around the world and having to work with everybody and And get those different personalities to mesh culturally or otherwise. That was a very interesting process. We were pretty good, I feel like, in the local hub and everybody that you saw on the daily. But it was like interesting once you started to get those other groups worked in and try to like, you know, thinking about setting up a server for Gavin. we were crammed in a tiny little apartment and he wanted something set up and I didn't do it fast enough. And I definitely heard a little bit from him and I probably could have been faster, but I didn't realize he was kind of just waiting on the other end for me. Um, so yeah, it was, it was just very interesting. I was, I was in my own little bubble with the Switzerland crew, but then, uh, gosh, it was probably only a few weeks before we got moved up and out into a larger house and things became much more complicated, much more quickly.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, just looking down through your photos, it says February the 9th is when you arrived in Europe. And then, yeah, February the 13th is when Stefan arrived at our tiny Airbnb. And then there was something on the 22nd about moving in somewhere. Oh, yeah, Richard and Ian arrived. On February the 22nd and, uh, Airbnb. So I guess that was a couple of few weeks of there before Ian and Richard arrived. Right. Then I'm just looking in March, March photos, Charles bought dinner for 10 people on March the first watching fight club.

SPEAKER_01: You know, like looking back and one thing that kind of stands out to me is it was definitely like a ragtag team of people there and trying to figure out what we were doing. Like this became a constant like a wedge in the group is like what our contribution was, right? from a code perspective and I was responsible for the website stuff. So I think to our credit, getting the team kind of motivated up and going to go from, we just met and within a couple of few weeks here, we started spinning prototypes of the website and working together in our different capacities to kind of get this machine in motion and prepared for what would eventually become the crowd sale. It's like kind of, No small task, I guess. Just having to learn how to get together and figure out your skills and know how you're going to plug into the rest of the global organization. But yeah, I think from February 12th, so just a few days after I landed, we kind of were up and moving on the website. And that was constantly a moving target too. Once we got additional legal guidance, and getting everybody's photos right and the right order and the right titles underneath. And that became a huge headache. And that wasn't even like the actual functioning app that took in Bitcoin and assigned like your key out. This was just months before in the run up to that. So it's just these personalities jiving, if you will. I believe that at the Miami time or shortly afterwards,

SPEAKER_03: um it was announced that the crowd sale would happen like within a month or two months it was like a really super short timeline that was that was thought at that point um but then yeah i guess all of that got delayed both with technical and more importantly like legal concerns yeah getting getting kind of our a legal footing uh where we as a team felt comfortable proceeding and and it wasn't just like one or two guys right you have to get you know

SPEAKER_01: eight, 10, 12 leaders going in the right same direction and get them to agree when they want vastly different things. But yeah, it was like, I think way back then the whole joke was two weeks, right? Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks. Everything was two weeks away and two weeks eventually turns into months and months because the crowd sale wasn't until what? June, July? July, August? I think July, August, September. Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: It was like, and I ran for what, 49 days or something like that. Um, and on the, so I was like in New York for the later part of this time. And it was funny to have the sort of stiff attorneys come by what was then our Times Square office, uh, which, um, I was there with Joe and Jonathan Mohan and Stephen Nareoff, now infamous. And yeah, I think there's always this global communication going on. And on the one hand, I think everyone was massaging the stiff law firm into... you know, what the parameters needed to be and the opinion letter and and so on and so forth. And, you know, I think from a capability perspective, technically, that was probably running faster, although we were not I think Joe spent a ton of time on like the terms of service and the docs and did a lot of the support during the crowd sale. But yeah, it was like the app was being developed. Who built the app that generated the wallets? I'm forgetting his name. The Romanian guy? The Romanian guy, yeah. Mariusz? I might be right. He might have gone and did he go to work at consensus afterwards? I think that might have been the case, but it could be misremembering. But the stats app, I thought it. I think that's right, too. Yeah. I forgot about that. There's a lot of facts from the early days that it's like, I don't know. Some of it's what we're thinking and some of it's like, I miss that.

SPEAKER_03: quite a lot of coordination overhead. And you know, I wasn't really in the center of it. But it was very visible. So I got Bob. So I mean, we're we're Vitalik, Gavin, Jeff, in zoo during those months, or was it just like, at that early bit, you know, in like February or so? Were they not even there? I don't remember Gavin and Jeff coming to visit zoo until

SPEAKER_01: after some time. Primarily in the earliest days, I remember Vitalik coming there. And then once Zug became kind of like the legal home, we started doing more and more meetings in person there, board meetings, things that needed to happen face to face. I don't think either of them were super keen on it. Gav loved Berlin. Jeff had a lot of family ties and whatnot to Amsterdam, so he didn't like to leave overnight if he could help it. He might come for a day trip. But in the beginning, beginning days, Vitalik would come and stay for a while. And that was kind of nice, honestly. Yeah. Because, I mean, what was happening during those months was the parallel development of three different clients, right? You've got Pyathat that Vitalik was working on. You've got Geth.

SPEAKER_03: that Jeff was leading, and then Gav building CPP Ethereum and speccing out the yellow paper. I mean, Jesus, Gav did so much work in those three months, like absolutely insane to get to the yellow paper so fast from there. So yeah, I can imagine he was just heads down and did not really want to talk to people during his time up.

SPEAKER_01: it felt like uh having Vitalik doing coding in Switzerland gave us a better balance because when Vitalik visited Berlin or uh Amsterdam it just it felt like the code went in the direction of wherever two of the three main developers were yeah and you know for better or worse people realize that they could, if they could bend Vitalik's ear, he had a difficult time saying no. And that means they could kind of set the agenda and direction of whatever they were trying to push, if you will. It was unfortunate that it was like, Um, way back then it was that easy to sway, but I think that's something Vitalik probably learned, uh, certainly by the time we launched the project, he was becoming more aware of how people, um, would, would use him in that way. Um, but in the end it all worked out we all had the three different clients that were interoperable to your point the amount of work that had to go into the yellow paper to take everybody's discussion and put and codify it into something that was even if imperfect uh close enough for the for the clients to be developed totally siloed from each other um i i still remark that as one of the best things that was accomplished whoever's goal that was probably gabs but Famously, I think, Bitcoin defined the implementation as the spec. And from a technical perspective, Ethereum had an actual spec and that you could derive any implementation you wanted from it. And that's something that the purest technology guy inside of me really appreciates.

SPEAKER_03: see it was it was a direct reaction to what happened in in bitcoin where satoshi had basically you know had this immaculate birth and then you could never really get to alternative implementations like even now really like it's never really nothing's ever really stuck and also i think just the act of of having that discipline of defining the spec and having multiple implementations, you know, that lets you triangulate between the different clients and say, oh, is there an ambiguity in the spec? So the spec, there's a bug in the spec, or is it a bug in a client? And then that's really had this sort of like division of powers kind of thing, right? That you haven't had a single group and a single code base and everything is stuck with that. you've had that kind of balance. And yeah, I mean, for the Haskell client, for Strato itself, you know, really benefited from that. You know, I mean, Kiran, and maybe say something about how that happened, that, you know, you could just build a new client.

SPEAKER_02: So I think this was also, yes, one of the great things about Ethereum was that it was always a really big tent. It was very open, in a way too open to Taylor's point, right? But I think on balance, the attitude was right. And I think later projects have been run much more like companies, but Ethereum, especially early on, felt like kind of, amorphous open source builder collective if you will um and so the spec was documented and so i i met our uh cto jim um uh i'm gonna say september 2014 yes september 2014 or thereabouts and we started talking about it and um maybe unbeknownst to me after our first discussion he started implementing the haskell version of uh ethereum to the point that it could sync didn't have all of the features in it and i started coding on it January, 2015, or maybe a little bit earlier than that. We would definitely find, you know, we'd like wake up one morning, it was syncing the night before you pull the latest and like some big module was added, like, you know, dev P2P. It's like, Oh, it takes an encryption now to, you know, connect and be able to sync the network. It didn't before and such like that. So, you know, I think there was definitely kind of like a, a, layers of access and consultation in terms of how the protocol evolved and so on. But it was cool. There were tests. We would run the VM tests and the results were provided and, you know, we would be, our CTO mostly would report on the percentage which passed, which would, you know, started. 80 or 90 percent and then go up to 97 and then something would change and we go down to 90 again. And, you know, eventually we made it all work in the end. So it's a really hard thing to do. I mean, other industries certainly like the aim, of course, is to have Ethereum be a protocol like HTTP or any other. And I think this was achieved or at least largely achieved. It was tough, you know, and just the communications between the teams were not I would say definitely kind of like a, whoever got to Vitalik last again to Taylor's point, but also sort of a insider outsider feeling was going on despite the openness of the project, almost a strange contradiction in terms, but all in all it's been, been a great run. Yeah. I think if there's anything to learn from having been involved in in Ethereum in

SPEAKER_01: by any stretch of the imagination in the early days is that despite the fact that we were all working on this, you know, quote unquote fairness protocol, it didn't take away from the fact that it was like real human beings with real problems that still had to write the software. And it was a really big growing up time for me emotionally to understand that everybody's different, differing needs.

SPEAKER_03: something i observed a few years later was um you've got to be very atypical to even be involved this early on right getting involved in this stuff is not something that like a normie is going to do you know hey there's this thing it may or may not work might be illegal but you know off we go give it you know give it a go so i think you know intrinsically you know these frontier folks prospector types, we're all a bit weird. So yeah, you get a bunch of those together, you're going to get a lot of friction and misunderstanding. And maybe a lot of people not great communication or emotional skills either. Yeah, from that perspective, it was probably a special time and place that enabled us

SPEAKER_01: kind of pull together as we did i mean if it weren't for bitcoin meetups and people normalizing sort of getting together with this sort of stuff even though to your point you kind of got to have a decent case of the the autism to even be interested in throwing your life at this um i don't know that that it could be recreated um

SPEAKER_03: just getting that kind of group of people together that had the skills and were able to put together at least enough social skills to make it all work yeah no i mean i think it's yeah a very sort of an exceptional um situation and event and i mean maybe you could say what what do you think might come out of ethereum what do you think could be built what you know what were your thoughts on how this might pan out like in an ideal sense ethereum generally well is that what you're asking is like how yeah yeah yeah i mean what do you think ethereum was going to be what what what what did you think these this these efforts could lead to um i think i understood in the earliest days that there were a lot of other possibilities

SPEAKER_01: Certainly 10 years down the road, we've explored a lot and found out some of them are more possible than others. I was also a large proponent of what Gavin was very into, which was like the three tent poles of decentralization. It was like storage and messaging and compute, I think. And that's something that I was very excited by. I think going back and looking at some of my early writings for Bitcoin magazine on some other like online publications, I had already been investigating different protocols built around Bitcoin. And so I think I was most excited by this idea of like rebuilding I mean, it's kind of what we joke we call Web three, but I think it had a more concrete idea way back when, which was like Web two, but decentralized, something that wasn't controlled and owned by the corporations or had more like anonymous abilities so that we can continue to communicate online without having to worry about like a real ID or anything like this. So I think it was a lot closer to the cypherpunk ideal of like maintaining free and open access of the internet for everybody was kind of the core tenants that I felt most passionate about with respect to Ethereum. far more so than building prediction markets or like a CryptoKitties. Not that those things aren't interesting, but that wasn't necessarily my focus. My focus was on how do we maintain an open Internet in light of the fact that we have corporations and governments that would like to apply censorship and control over it? Yeah. So, I mean, those three sub protocols were

SPEAKER_03: ethereum you know so your decentralized compute um swarm so swarms your decentralized storage with incentives layer on top of it and then whisper was the decentralized um messaging so whisper kind of died it didn't really work um it turns out um there's a there's a successor to that called waku which status have been developing for a good amount of time swarm is still going but you know has ended up being very little used um ipfs like really sort of seem to win there apart from it hasn't got the incentive layer uh which is what filecoin is trying to build on top of that but you know I think um and this one other now what's it I forget the name but but yeah I think it's it's sort of like with all of these things you could do a decentralized anything, right. That you could, that you could have your, your smart contracts executing your logic, that decentralized storage could store like your, your web content, you know, that you have a hosted front end that was all kind of within that, that kind of system, you know, like a bit torrenty kind of thing, but with incentives, um, and then that, uh, that messaging there. So, yeah. That was really exciting to me as well. Cause it's like, oh, here's like a computer, here's a platform and you can do all of the things that you, that you could do with a, with a web two, but in a completely, you know, unstoppable way with built in payments and you can build whatever incentive mechanism you like. And text just talked about like a, a social operating system, society operating system. Do you or, or Kieran or anybody else up, up here, do they, do they,

SPEAKER_01: Does anyone feel that Ethereum didn't accomplish what it set out to accomplish in light of the fact that we really just shipped the compute layer? Do we miss the mark in any way? You know, it's a great question. I think the...

SPEAKER_02: I think the answer is no, just in the sense that you put something out there and you don't really know how people are going to use it. Like the world computer was a really compelling vision. And to your point, it didn't shake out exactly that way, right? It doesn't feel like a complete computer. It feels like an economy and is only doing certain parts of the economy. But I think that's totally okay, right? Just getting anything that changes how the world functions done is so important. And honestly, one probably needs to specialize in general from there. And probably what you see after Ethereum is yet more specialization. You know, our projects are way more narrowly tailored on average than Ethereum as a whole. So maybe it's just it was like too much to chew and like a little bit impossible, you know, in a way. And there's, you know, I mean, actually, I just don't hear that much about IPFS lately. Like, it doesn't feel like... the demand for sensor-proof everything on the internet is that strong right now? If something would have to happen for there to be really big uptake in need again. People have, to your point, kind of forgotten that part. And it may happen again. I mean, we see pretty strong speech controls coming out of the EU, especially as regards the internet. So we might see another wave, but even the attempts at sort of like crypto-native social have all been about... financialization versus uncensorability, the ones that have caught on to some degree. And financialization is also just really important, you know. But yeah, so I guess I'm saying, so maybe it's, you know, it's not the complete original vision, but it's not his fault. It's sort of like where the demand went, in my opinion. What

SPEAKER_01: what about do you either you guys this wasn't a part of my original question but i'm looking at the photos here and uh i don't know in in one case i kind of feel like the area that ethereum failed a little bit was the whole dowification of various aspects um Ethereum itself never really became a DAO. We tried the DAO and that had famously a bug that we had have like a white hat hacker group help recover funds from. And then a lot of DAOs get set up today, which are essentially just money funnels. I don't know, maybe it was too out there of an idea, maybe not concrete enough for anything to be considered and reconciled as a DAO, but the whole turning things into a DAO just never seemed to transpire, even though it was technically possible with just the compute layer. You know, and I'll throw it over to Bob in a second, but I think...

SPEAKER_02: It didn't happen. I agree. And I know both of you were kind of heavily involved with the foundation, which could have pushed that along harder or been sort of a legal brick and mortar host for the DAO as opposed to whatever it is and was. And we've seen a couple kind of work. It seems like the DeFi DAOs are okay, and they may be a little bit centralized in decision making and so on, but they actually seem to serve a purpose. And sometimes they're kind of like intimately involved in the protocols. I'm thinking like... the Aave DAO or the Uniswap DAO, etc. So like people have been able to achieve it on Ethereum. Right. And so like, why didn't Ethereum itself achieve it? Also, I mean, there's things that could be done that aren't like we could take stake weighted votes on things, for instance. And I think it's never really been done other than stake staking itself. And I don't know why. I think maybe later entrants sort of had to do it from a transparency perspective. But I think it's a will thing more than anything. One, it's like a really intense effort just to keep the network up and so on. And then it got really big and you didn't want to change it, kind of, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, I agree it didn't happen, and I think it could have happened, and I don't know. You know, there's definitely a gap there, and I don't really know the why.

SPEAKER_02: Also, I mean, on that Web3 vision, you know, that the other leg's not landing,

SPEAKER_03: think the one that has been like a painful failing is to do with work front ends you know that many many applications though they may have you know smart contract back ends even without admin keys you know just code is law smart contracts they're often still going through a conventional work from a junction point, a failure point, often legally, like that's happened a lot on privacy or mixing things is people get like done for hosting the front end, even if the smart contracts are, you know, are immutable and out there. So that's been one problem area. I think part of that, though, is nobody wants to run servers like i think this was something that i had a quite different thought on at the beginning is like yeah you know everyone we can run decentralized everything right and it's all unstoppable and perfect but the fact is nobody wants to run servers like for anything like let alone like something that's really heavyweight um and i think that was kind of you know the vision you know say you have missed right you can run run a browser and it's going to have pull, pull the things from swarm and perfectly decentralized. But you know, that, that stuff just, I think was, was quite naive because the, the cost and overhead of running a node is really quite high. Let alone if you want to get the throughput that you'd need for sort of worldwide trade. So yeah, we've ended up with a lot less throughput and a lot less people running their own stuff. And then that's all the complexities of L2. So yeah.

SPEAKER_01: I think that's, I don't know how you solve that. I hold Apple partially responsible for making such good laptops that everybody started switching over to laptops. I think way back then, a lot more people had desktops. So the idea of having idle storage and compute just sitting there was a greater thing. But now that a lot of people, myself included, don't even really bust out the laptop. I live on my phone, work on my phone, and there's no good way to support the network as a server client on the phone. So to some degree, it feels like the mobilification of all of our devices is to blame for some of those original issues.

SPEAKER_03: ideas not panning out as we had hoped. Yeah, no, I'd agree. And I mean, I spent the first thing I was doing on Ethereum was doing ARM Linux cross builds to get a client running on smartphones, smartwatch, Raspberry Pi and all of that. And I have the real naive view at that point. It's like, all right, yeah, just get it working. And, you know, there'll be some like client thing and, you know, you can just do everything right. And this will just be like a background task or, hey, you know, we're defining this protocol and like Ethereum will just be a protocol that will just be in operating systems. It will just be part of the Linux, you know, part of the Linux distro. You know, you're just right here. You've got Ethereum running in the background and, you know, off you go. And that's why it never really took off in the way that it was originally envisioned, I don't think. No, no. And then on that DAO, the DAO question, I think maybe it's as simple as that, um, people don't care about lots of things, right? It's kind of like having a job, having to participate in a doubt. You have to try and understand what's going on. And like, you know, I don't, you know, I think that's a human scaling thing, right? It was a sort of a, we don't like hierarchy kind of naivety. You know, like hierarchies are a scaling mechanism. You know, they help us solve large scale problems by breaking things up. I think having hierarchies that you can never change and be powerless within is a terrible thing, but hierarchies per se, I think are very useful. DAO is sort of like a condo association, right? Very much so. Who wants to be involved in that? Only one tyrant. That's right. So, so yeah, talking about the red wedding or, or really just really the, you know, the birth of the Ethereum foundation, right. Because you were a, uh, you were a director on that at the start of the Ethereum foundation. So how, how did all that like resolve into, into what came out of that in the form of the. Yeah. So I was, I had the dates, uh, clicked away on my timeline, but, um,

SPEAKER_03: think the one that has been like a painful failing is to do with work front ends you know that many many applications though they may have you know smart contract back ends even without admin keys you know just code is law smart contracts they're often still going through a conventional work from a junction point, a failure point, often legally, like that's happened a lot on privacy or mixing things is people get like done for hosting the front end, even if the smart contracts are, you know, are immutable and out there.

SPEAKER_01: I think that's, I don't know how you solve that. I hold Apple partially responsible for making such good laptops that everybody started switching over to laptops. I think way back then, a lot more people had desktops. So the idea of having idle storage and compute just sitting there was a greater thing. But now that a lot of people, myself included, don't even really bust out the laptop. I live on my phone, work on my phone, and there's no good way to support the network as a server client on the phone. So to some degree, it feels like the mobilification of all of our devices is to blame for some of those original issues.

I live on my phone, work on my phone, and there's no good way to support the network as a server client on the phone. So to some degree, it feels like the mobilification of all of our devices is to blame for some of those original issues.

SPEAKER_03: ideas not panning out as we had hoped. Yeah, no, I'd agree. And I mean, I spent the first thing I was doing on Ethereum was doing ARM Linux cross builds to get a client running on smartphones, smartwatch, Raspberry Pi and all of that. And I have the real naive view at that point. It's like, all right, yeah, just get it working. And, you know, there'll be some like client thing and, you know, you can just do everything right. And this will just be like a background task or, hey, you know, we're defining this protocol and like Ethereum will just be a protocol that will just be in operating systems. It will just be part of the Linux, you know, part of the Linux distro. You know, you're just right here. You've got Ethereum running in the background and, you know, off you go. And that's why it never really took off in the way that it was originally envisioned, I don't think. No, no. And then on that DAO, the DAO question, I think maybe it's as simple as that, um, people don't care about lots of things, right? It's kind of like having a job, having to participate in a doubt. You have to try and understand what's going on. And like, you know, I don't, you know, I think that's a human scaling thing, right? It was a sort of a, we don't like hierarchy kind of naivety. You know, like hierarchies are a scaling mechanism. You know, they help us solve large scale problems by breaking things up. I think having hierarchies that you can never change and be powerless within is a terrible thing, but hierarchies per se, I think are very useful. DAO is sort of like a condo association, right? Very much so. Who wants to be involved in that? Only one tyrant. That's right. So, so yeah, talking about the red wedding or, or really just really the, you know, the birth of the Ethereum foundation, right. Because you were a, uh, you were a director on that at the start of the Ethereum foundation. So how, how did all that like resolve into, into what came out of that in the form of the.

SPEAKER_01: I think that's, I don't know how you solve that. I hold Apple partially responsible for making such good laptops that everybody started switching over to laptops. I think way back then, a lot more people had desktops. So the idea of having idle storage and compute just sitting there was a greater thing.
