**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Hear me? Can you hear me?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, I can.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Excellent.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Happy strato spaces, Gm. What's up, guys?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** How are you?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** I'm good. First week of September. I'm not sure if it's officially the first week of fall, but nevertheless, super excited for a new month. I know at Strata, we have a very exciting month ahead.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** I think technically, fall starts on either 21st or 22nd, but spiritually, it starts after Labor Day. Of course, I don't know if anyone has a, you know, white suit, but you can. I actually sort of have a white suit. And you can no longer wear those already.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** I might have to see that. White suit's pretty. Pretty nice.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** I may have a photo. I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings, and that's the only time it's been. But I could probably dig one up for you, Jamie.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, Texture welcome.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** We had them. We lost them.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Give it a. Give it a few more minutes for some more folks. Pile in. Yeah, yeah. Spiritually, fall is here, along with football, to the behest of our European counterparts.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** By the way, for spaces resiliency, ChatGPT is recommending two co hosts up front. Now, do we already have the two, or can you add another one?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, you and Bob are co hosts.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Okay. It just appears as speaker to me. Maybe it appears as co host to Bob on Bob's side. Bob, are you a co host successfully?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** It appears so.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** I see it now.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Okay.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Fantastic.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Can you hear me?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** All right, cool.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Wait. Very, very kind of cool. August for. For those of us who spent some of it in New York, like, August is supposed to be hot, and it mostly wasn't like the. There's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall, but it feels.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Like it kind of.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Of started early this year. I don't know what's going on.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, completely agree. A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Bit cooler.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** You guys are old. Sitting around talking about the weather.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** We're waiting for you.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Well, I'm here.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Even better.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Welcome.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** What's up, gm?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, great. Great to kick this off. I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just want to pay my compliments to your. Pft. Texture. It's. It's quite the Good. Quite a good one, so. Well, thanks, man.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** You own a texture pump?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** I do not, but I saw a few folks with them and obviously noticed yours, so might. Might have to. Might have to get one.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** It was a joke because I thought punks were ugly, so I made myself a better one, and then A friend asked me to make her one and then somebody else asked me to make one. And then like 30 people later, I was like, I should just make a little thing where they can make their own. And then, then, then my buddy started a Discord and 10,000 people showed up. And I was like, look.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** That'S some good lore. That's some great lore right there.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** I thought it was going to be me and my hundred friends.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Always good.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** I mean, I could waste this entire.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Thing telling that story. That's probably not what people want to hear.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** I mean, I think there's a lot of. It's, it's not that I think the.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Problems are unsolvable, but they're, you know, the idea that it's something from above being imposed down.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** You know, despite the.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Fact that the system seemed to be that way. I think a lot of it is just the, the, the level of complexity of modern life relative to the average intelligence is, it's just, it's, it's a wide gap and there's a lot of. I mean, I could talk about that for 10 hours too, so.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well, I mean, something that I saw in those early days of Ethereum as well was a real kind of almost like allergic reaction to anything that looked like organization or hierarchy or structure. You know, just like this total flip to the opposite side. Right. Everything's got to be flat and open and, you know, everything. Everyone involved with everything, which is just completely impractical for actually organizing or doing anything. Y think I can't. Yeah, it's just, it's just nutty. So, but then it's like I realized it's like hierarchy isn't the problem. Being trapped in a hierarchy where it's to your detriment and you can't get out is the problem.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** You know.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** And a lot of. And I think a lot of times what happens is smart people, you know, smart people aren't really, they don't really understand. Not smart people. And so what happens is we, we are born into a world where these preexisting hierarchies exist and they've, you know, to some degree or another, you know, kind of persisted through, through generation after generation. And then we come in and we're like, why am I at the bottom of this hierarchy? I'M smart. We're all too smart for this. And then they try to, like, you know, they try to create new systems assuming that everyone is approximately like them. And then, you know, I've. I've been through so many because again, coming through the hippie, I was in the Bay Area for a long time. You see so many people think that they're the first person to ever think of flat hierarchies and how it's going to be so much better. And at the end of the day, man, like, that's fine if you want to talk all the time and you want to argue and you want to get nothing done. But at the end of the day, a hierarchy is an information structure, and it's also an accountability structure. And so as long as there's accountability at the top, and as long as the information is flowing correctly and as long as the outputs are optimal to some degree, then it's the best you're going to get. And it doesn't mean we can't continually improve. Obviously, life gets better and we have an obligation. You know, I think when you're creating things, it's not just the creating things. And I think this is a big problem that still exists in crypto. People think if you build it, they will come. You can't just build it. You have to build it, and then you have to make it a button, a single button. It has to be so simple. Your grandma can do it and not destroy her life. And so it is this kind of perpetual attempt to take these complex structures, simplify them so that everyone has access to them. But through that simplification, not creating these kind of hells that no one can get out of. And I think, you know, just because of the rate of technological development and the nature of economic progress, our opportunities as people trapped in those systems is to build new systems. But ultimately we're going to come face to face with the reality of why those systems were set up the way they were and understand that the best we can really hope for in most instances is an optimization of that. We can try to make it simpler, more efficient, better and more adaptable. But those are a lot of dimensions that any one of them out of, out of sync is going to. Is going to create either more problems or the system itself will collapse.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Right. And, you know, if the system doesn't.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Exist, then nobody gets.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Nobody gets anything.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a little bit analogous to sort of technical debt and things in code.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yep.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Is if you, if you've Got code. And there's. And you're like, jesus, look at this. It's so much like complexity and these conditions. I don't think we need any of that. Let's just take all that out. But, you know, someone did that for a reason. You may not know the reason, but you know, it was done for a reason. And you know you're going to have some consequence if you, if you do that. Right. You, you can only be so simple without being, you know, too simplistic. And then you, you miss out on that. Correct that detail. Yeah, I mean, I guess it's like you, you know, with, with sort of us legal stuff, you know, this, this hot liquid might burn you or whatever. You just know that some shit's happened in the past. Right. The reason that all of these things have happened is someone's done something.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Really stupid.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. And I, you know, as. After I became a father, I became really a huge proponent of the idea of. If you think a stupid rule exists because the person who made it is stupid, you haven't thought through the problem. It isn't a bunch of people. Now, I'm not saying this has never existed, but it's not like some nefarious guy at the top who wants to just ruin your life. It's some idiot who did some idiot. And then now you got to make a stupid rule. You know what I mean? And you got to enforce it with fire. Otherwise, you know, your kids end up dumping plates of food in their closet and you find it six months later. And so, you know, it's, it's just status scale. But you're going to have to keep me on topic as much as you want to, because I am a meanderer.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah. On.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** On this human side, something I, I talked about during my maple syrup peace phase was, was neurodiversity and the fact.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** That.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Normies would not be involved in the early phases of such a project. Right. It's absolutely crazy to go and do what you did.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Crazy what most people did. So how does that play out? The fact that in these frontier technology you don't have normal people? Well, you do, but you have a lot of us people who would not fall into that category. So how does that all play out? What, what do you think's happening there?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** I think it's just the structure of how things have always occurred. Right. So you have these kind of people on the front edge. And I, and I was on the Internet from. You know, I remember reading when the HTML 2.0 spec was about to come out, right? And so the early days of the Internet it was that. And so I was on the Internet all day talking to people and you know, there was a technical barrier and it's just you have these kind of neurodivergent people show up. So in the early days of crypto it was a lot of people who were paranoid, a lot of autistic people and spattering of sociopaths who kind of could see that they could make money. And so that, that has a profound effect on how things play out. But I think it seems the way that at least in capitalism what happens is huge amounts of capital come in and it just becomes this kind of probability matrix of throw as much energy at this thing as you can on the front end and then whatever survives is going to play out. But kind of if you look at something like Linux or open source technology in general, it's like very autistic. And autistic people have a very specific, I've noticed differentiation from the average person which is they, they honestly like believe that the terminal is the greatest interface of all time. It's like they don't grasp that most people need buttons. And so it's like you look at Linux, Linux was kind of a fringe thing, only tech people used. And then Google came in and at least had enough sense to like hire some designers to turn it into something functional. Steve Jobs did the same thing with osx. You know, OSX was a, a previous like Unix variant. And so you, you need those people, you need those people who come in who are, who are on the edge, who are technical enough to, to be able to communicate with the technical people and understand. But they also need the clout, the money and the power to overrule those people. Because like Linux had like very horrible user interface and user experience for a long time, even when they had window managers. And you have to understand I was a designer. So I would go into these open source spaces and I'm going to tell you what man. Like these people who for sure would not let you comment on their code and for sure not let you tell you how they were going to structure it, or for sure not tell you, you know, tell them what language they're going to use, have no problem stepping outside of their, their own expertise and driving a designer insane. You know what I mean? Very logical, unemotional, totally tapped out of any sense of like what a normal person needs. And they, they just beat the designers into the ground. So you really need somebody who has power and the Competence and the will and the desire and, and can put it all together. And I don't think we really see that.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** You know what I mean?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** The wallets fucking suck. I don't know now, but a year ago I clicked a button and emptied my hot wallet. And that shouldn't be possible. How hard is it to throw up a fucking thing that says hey, are you meaning to send every bit of this? This is a lot of money, you know, like, why does it not just say hey? It didn't even say it in dollars, do you know what I mean? It was, it was obfuscated. It didn't even say there should have been a massive pop up that said you're about to send a hundred thousand dollars to somebody. Are you sure you want to do this?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Or, or, or I, as soon as I clicked the button, knew what had happened. Even if there had been like a five minute, you know, delay. Right.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Anything. There's, there's. But none. This isn't happening. Right. And, and whether it be the structure of the organizations or, you know, if the designers are having to argue with the tech people, like whatever it is, it's just grandma still can't use this. It's 10 years in if I will and the energy, I, I could, you know what I mean? I could like within six months we could, we could solve these problems. And I just don't see.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, I guess I, I guess this is the reason why things like the ETFs are so appealing. Right? Is just.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Can I just not deal with any of this at all? But I can just like use bridge account I've already got and it's just a thing that I buy or sell. Right. And, and just, you know, it's a proxy for it, but most people don't care.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. But that, that reduces it to an investment vehicle. Right?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** It does, it does, it does.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** And, and maybe it does.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** And then that's, that's really a failure, as you say on, on delivery of, of, of the holistic platform that, that you do need something which is absolutely better. Right. It's just like a product question really. Right. Is saying unless the product that you are offering is absolutely better than something existing or is cheaper or gives you some other benefits or whatever, then normal people are not going to use. Doesn't matter what the, what the, you know.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Correct.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** What your worldview is behind that. You've given them something that's worse than what they have, so they don't care.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. And so, you know, I think exchanges and Things like that kind of acting as a buffer is, you know, it's, it's a step. I mean, you know, ultimately, how are these things going to be used? The end user is probably not going to know, you know, what they're using on the back end any more than the average person knows what processor is in their phone. So.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, I mean, I guess the hope is it's like a layering thing, right? That, you know, in the same way as you've got those defi primitives that you're going to lay, you know, whatever social recovery or buffered amounts or whatever, or insurance for UPS or all this sort of stuff. Right. That you should be able to put together a stack of things that have an equivalent kind of characteristic and experience to existing things, but without that strong dependence on, you know, a single legal entity that's, you've got that customer service provider kind of pattern, rather than just it being raw, dangerous, as you experienced there.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah. And I mean, you know, to this day, I mean, I feel anxious all the time because I, because I hold crypto, you know, me, I feel anxious all the time.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean, I think we all, I think we all do.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** So it's like that's not an experience that the average person wants. The average person wants to put their money in a bank account. The average person wants to click a button and if something goes wrong to be able to reverse it. You know, we haven't really addressed any of that. That's, it's again, just a, it's a failure because the people who are in charge think like anyone can do what they're doing and it's not that big of a deal and like, all you have to do is do this and like, blah, blah. It's like, no, dude, if all they have to do is click a button, you've done it. That's, that's your metric for success. Click one button and not worry about anything. You just know the thing is going to happen and if it doesn't, it'll get fixed.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So, I mean, when I was looking through sort of different phases of this period that I've been covering in the, in the early days of Ethereum sort of website, there I, I was noticing. So in, in the January, In January and February 2014, there's just such a flood of people that came in. I mean, there were a fair chunk in December, but that just really accelerated through January and February. So, I mean, how, how did that like play out that you've just got like tons and Tons of people, you know, rocking up and really, like, volunteering.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Turned everything into Game of Thrones.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, that's what happened. It turned everything into Game of Thrones. So, like, I was there day one, I was doing. I was making sure, like, you know, the first thing I did was Vitalik posted this website that he made. It was piss yellow. He had stolen some other shit, coins logo and just put Ethereum on it. And I was like, please don't post this. Give me till tomorrow. So I, like, spun up a logo, sent it to him. He was like, oh, yeah, this is kind of what I was thinking. I was like, thank God. Please don't put that out. I don't know if I made a website or. And then somebody submitted an image, but the image was like, like. And so just real quick, like, what I used to do is I used to be, like, the dude who dev shops would call when they were six months behind on a project and they needed it done in three days. Right. So I was a designer, full stack developer. So my. My skill was I could take your idea and I could. I could make it look like it existed forever. And you had $10 million in funding in 24 hours. Right. So that was my goal at that point. Once I realized that that was a massive gap, I just inserted myself there. And I'm only telling the story to say then when everybody flooded in and especially when the Zug house happened, you had all these people kind of going behind other people's backs and trying to push people out and take over their roles. And it was. It was just a very stressful, weird time because you get. You just get a different type of person, right? The type of people who show up and are just wanting to build the thing because it's cool. That's the type of person. But when they show up and they're like, yeah, let's. Let's make sure it's us. Let's make sure we're the ones. Let's like, those people. Let's not communicate with them. So there was a lot of, like, political maneuvering that was required to survive.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And I mean, I guess that Miami house was where that, like, really, like, dug in, because that was the first time that most people were physically in the same location out of that set of.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** It was pretty fun. The weirdest part about that was meeting Charles. And, you know, Charles, I. He might have been the first person who is doing kind of the thing that I just said, Right. Like, yeah, showed up and kind of inserted himself and was like, I'm going to be CEO and I'm. He was just, he's just a fucking liar though, man. He was like 24 or something and he 25. Yeah, he presented himself like he was 50 years old and he'd been in tech forever. And here's the thing, man, I actually was probably the most experienced in terms of. I lived in Silicon Valley, I'd worked in multiple startups. But like, despite my personality on Twitter or even if you meet me in person, like, I'm pretty humble when I get into a group of people that I can tell have skills. So I kind of just sat back and didn't try to insert myself. I didn't try to like, demand, you know, I be involved in this or that. I just tried to kind of be as helpful as I could. So, you know, when I, when I talked to Charles for the first time, I was like, all right, you know, this dude's kind of weird. Like, but we'll see what's up. So, like, literally the moment I met him in Miami, I shook his hand and I was like, oh God, he's a sociopath. Like, okay, well, maybe he's our sociopath, you know, like every company has a sociopath. Like, maybe he's like a well regulated sociopath. And then when we got to the Miami house, I found out, no, no, he's not a well regulated sociopath. He's a compulsive liar, manipulative weirdo. Aaron, were you gonna say something?

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** I was just gonna say, in Charles defense, at that time, he did look 50 years old, bro.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** When I found out he was like seven years younger than me, I was like, what the. Why am I deferring to this kid? He like, what the hell? So, yeah, it was, it was weird, man. Like, in the Miami house, I, he just said some weird to me. Like, he showed me. I'll tell this one because I told it publicly a lot of times, but he was like, texture, Come here. And I'm like, what's up? And he's like, check out this text message. And I'm like, okay. And I like, just met the dude and he shows me this text message and it's a chick and she's like, I want to suck your so bad. Sorry for any children listening. And I'm like, why the fuck is he showing me this? And he's like, you know where I met her? I was like, no. He's like, I met her on the front lines of Afghanistan when I was working for darpa. I'm like, Jesus Christ, dude. Oh my God, shut the up. And so I will say this because it's something that bothers me. Like for some reason the media all says that the reason that Charles was kicked out was because he wanted to make it corporate when every single person filed their own corporate legal entity in an attempt to divert the funds to their own personal power structure.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I'll, I'll add because I was in the room for some of this. So, and. And Bob, at your request, of course, I was digging through the emails, trying to piece together some pieces of the timeline, you know, yesterday, day before. So I had, I think by March, I was talking with Vitalik and, you know, I was in academia at that time, and he kind of found it useful to bounce, like, protocol, economic modeling stuff off, you know, like, I was, like, good at reading the white papers and understand what they were doing. I could, you know, kind of code at that time. I could still kind of code today, but that sort of. We ended up talking about, like, how the thing should work at a, you know, theory, protocol level more than an implementation level. And that kind of, I guess. And this was covered in the. In the Red Wedding time, there was like, we, you know, a discussion of the usage of funds that ended up, like on a whiteboard or something. And a lot of it was theoretically earmarked for a research group that meant to solve, you know, hard problems like scalability in crypto that, you know, like, in practice people have sort of solved today. And not by any of the means we imagined exactly, but, you know, they've been solved to some degree at least. Like with layer twos, for instance, scalability was very much anticipated as a problem. And, you know, it took a couple years, but you know, we had like $55 fees on NFT transfers at some point.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** So I think.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Vitalik sort of like.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** Talk.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** We talked about this for a little bit and then he kind of like blessed me as like the representative who's currently in academia. I started contacting people and trying to get them interested in Ethereum and then doing like research related to it in general. We even like set a legal entity up for a separate research group at some point. And I'm trying to remember. So textured. We mostly work together just on the sites basically. Like you were like, you know, web designer at that time, but I remember.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I was doing web design.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** We.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** We had talked about the CRG cryptocurrency research group and I was like, that's cool. Let me build a website. I remember throwing, you know, faces on it and then it just kind of put it out, which, you know, it's, you know, like it would have, it would have been a like cool thing, fun thing. I don't know. But also there's a story about Diorio. Not. Anyways, I, like, I didn't know people were getting paid for a long time and I was like living on my sister's love seat in her one bedroom apartment with my daughter because I was like homeless and working on Ethereum as much as I could, like multiple other jobs to, to try to make money. And I contact Diorio contacted me one day because he was, you know, he was in the earlier days, like the, the primary contact that I would talk to the most. And he called me and he asked me for a favor and I was like, yeah man, no problem. And I said, hey, by the way, if you, you know, like, listen, I'm in a bad spot right now. Is there any way I could get like back pay for ten grand? Which you know, was not much. And this dude just says, oh no. And I was like, what the. Anyways, I talked to Vitalik.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** The.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** The way it goes back to the CRG is the CRG was supposed to pay me $5,000. So you owe me $5,000, Kieran. I. I don't know. You know, given that it was so early, if you could just pay me an ETH relative to the price at that time. That'd be sick.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Exactly 20 cents was the pre sale price.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, something.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Something like that. So it'd be like quite the, quite the amount of ETH.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, so just like 15,000 ETH and we'll call it even.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** All right.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** All right.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, many. That was the case for many people through those, those months, you know for some people that was nine, 10 months of unpaid contributions.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** My, my memory is also that Anthony was the main force behind sort of actually not quite stopping but delaying the funding to the ccrg. So like somehow we got it some of it way later. Diorio and Diorio. Yeah. And it was like not quite the original amount but it was still some. But we were all like working on different things at that time so we ended up returning it I think. But yeah it was a strange like the, the strange delay that happened I guess like right after the pre sale so before people are working uncompensated or largely uncompensated and then right after there was I suppose like a big cash grab going on. So like Bob maybe you know better than us. So there were a bunch of legal entities getting set up. Like there was like the Berlin Dev company and then there was another one like in each. Everyone tried to like pull out as much of the piece as they could but like.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, good.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So. So Anthony, the Oreo, not you.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Incorporated Ethereum Canada in February actually. But it was about. It was just a few days before everyone went to Zug so his thought I guess was everything was going to happen out of Toronto but that didn't happen. You had Ethereum Swiss got formed in Switzerland somewhere in April I think. You had GAV incorporating Ethereum Dev in Berlin, Jeff in Amsterdam though that took quite a few months more legalities to it and there was a. There was an Ethereum in London as well. Most of those FDEV ones were kind of co. Founded by Vitalik and GAV and Jeff and Mihaly kind of group. Yeah, it was only the, the, the Toronto one there where it was that I could see Anthony was a director. I don't think he was ever a director on any of the other legal entities. They were basically the you know, the dead people and, or Mihaly and Taylor. But, but yeah when, when you'd had the crowd sale and the, the stichting had been formed and then were the recipients of those funds there was a whole power grab of a mess of how those funds went out and you know. Yeah, who, how that was done and in cryptopians it talks about GAV maybe wanting to like grab all of the money straight into Dev but then it's like that's probably not legal and it's probably not a good idea either and Joe wanting to do it sort of a milestone based slow delivery which is I think what it sort of ended up being. But you did have this sort of weird situation where you'd say, oh, do you work for the Ethereum Foundation? But very few people actually work for the Ethereum Foundation. Most people were actually working as staff or contractors for these for profit legal entities which were sort of doing the work.

**[00:00] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, I think, I guess
