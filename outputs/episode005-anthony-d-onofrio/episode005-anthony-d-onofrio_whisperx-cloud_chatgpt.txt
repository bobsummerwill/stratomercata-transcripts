SPEAKER_04: Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

SPEAKER_00: Yes, I can. Excellent. Happy Strato Spaces. GM. What's up, guys? How are you?

SPEAKER_04: I'm good. First week of September. I'm not sure if it's officially the first week of fall. But nevertheless...

SPEAKER_00: Super excited for a new month. I know at Strato we have a very exciting month ahead. I think technically fall starts on the 21st or 22nd, but spiritually it starts after Labor Day, of course. I don't know if anyone has a white suit, but I actually sort of have a white suit. And you can no longer wear those already. I might have to see that. White suit's pretty nice. I may have a photo. I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings, and that's the only time it's been. But I could probably dig one up for you, Jamie. Yeah. Text, you're welcome. We had him, we lost him.

SPEAKER_04: Give it a few more minutes for some more folks to pile in. Yeah, yeah. Spiritually fall is here, along with football, to the behest of our European counterparts.

SPEAKER_00: By the way, for Spaces resiliency, ChatGPT is recommending two co-hosts up front. Now, do we already have the two, or can you add another one? Yes, you and Bob are co-hosts. Okay, it just appears as speaker to me. Maybe it appears as co-host to Bob on Bob's side. Bob, are you a co-host successfully? It appears so. I see it now. Okay, fantastic. Can you hear me? All right, cool. Wait, very, very kind of cool August for those of us who spent some of it in New York. August is supposed to be hot, and it mostly wasn't. There's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall, but it feels like it kind of started early this year. I don't know what's going on.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, completely agree. A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night. Cooler. You guys are old, been around, talking about the weather. We're waiting for you.

SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm here. Even better. Welcome. What's up? GM.

SPEAKER_04: Yeah, great. Great to kick this off. I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just want to pay my compliments to your PFP, Texture. It's quite a good one.

SPEAKER_03: Thanks, man.

SPEAKER_04: Do you own a Texture Punk?

SPEAKER_03: I do not, but I saw a few folks with them and obviously noticed yours, so might have to get one.

SPEAKER_03: It was a joke because I thought punks were ugly. So I made myself a better one. And then a friend asked me to make her one and then somebody else asked me to make one. And then like 30 people later, I was like, I should just fucking make a little thing where they can make their own. And then my buddy started a Discord and 10,000 people showed up and I was like, look, that's some good lore. That's some great lore right there. I thought it was going to be me and my hundred friends. Accidental success. Fantastic. Great. All right. Well, let's get going. So hi, Texture. How are you? It's been a while. It's been a long time.

SPEAKER_06: Always good. When I think of you, the first thing I think of is love. Oh, and something I've spotted going through making my notes is your Medium is called Peace Love Revolution. Yes. So what's the story there?

SPEAKER_03: So, you know, I was kind of, I wouldn't say a hippie. I didn't dress like a hippie. I didn't really hang out with hippies, but I took some psychedelics when I was a kid and I had some experiences and, you know, kind of drove my passion for doing good things and spreading love in the world. I know people that probably follow me are like, what the—he just calls people retards all day. Yeah, but I mean, I'm on Twitter. I don't know. It's full of retards. So I started this group called Peace Love Human because I was sitting in a shitty basement apartment in San Francisco and I was watching the news and I was seeing how religions got all fucked up. And I was like, what if there was a religion that didn't have any beliefs? And we just went out and did nice shit. So for like three years of my life, I was just like homeless and had no job and was setting up like free hug events and other stuff just to make people smile. Because making people feel loved or making people happy was not a quantifiable metric, but making people smile was. So that was what I did for my early 20s. So that's what I was doing, the community building. I accidentally started a cult. And when I realized that it was a cult, I shut it down. Okay. But it helped me. It was my first foray into cult building, which obviously...

SPEAKER_06: Right. Very useful.

SPEAKER_03: I took on my role in Ethereum, and I feel like the Ethereum cult is going pretty well.

SPEAKER_06: I seem to remember at some point you told me that you've probably hugged a thousand random people on the street.

SPEAKER_03: Oh, a thousand in a day, probably. Probably a hundred thousand more. Yeah. It was nice. It was good. I could waste this entire thing telling that story. That's probably not what people want to hear.

SPEAKER_06: I mean, I can see why Decentralized Dance Party also appealed to you on that school.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's—so DDP, Gary, the guy who runs that, he came and stayed in my apartment in Brooklyn. We had this three-story loft in a warehouse and we'd let people come crash and he came through and that's how I met him. And I've done three or four of them. I was Tom. So Tom is like a rotate—I was Tom one time. So that was fun. I had to shave my beard. I had a mustache. I looked funny. I'll drop some links on Twitter for that for anyone who hasn't seen Decentralized Dance Party or you can go and have a Google on your own. It's quite exceptional. It's funny. I had no...

SPEAKER_06: Didn't really understand the decentralized thing at that point. I was not really involved. So he was kind of ahead of the curve on that with me for sure. So yeah, that's Gary Lachance, who was a fellow Vancouverite with me. He was, funnily enough, in a photo for the very first item I could find about Vancouver Decentral. You know, the whole Decentral Toronto-Vancouver thing. Gary was in that photo for the first one. Maybe well known as well now, but for DogeClaren. So there is the Doge-wrapped McLaren which travels around many conferences where they can get financial support for that. Yeah, Gary's a great guy. It's pretty fun. So tell me about the vision that you had, which was then the same as the white paper. Because on the Twitter thread, I was wrongly saying your mind was blown by the Ethereum white paper, where actually what happened was that you'd had a vision of this about a week before...

SPEAKER_03: And then the white paper landed on your lap. So what the hell was that about? Yeah, so what actually happened was I had a roommate for years ago, like years when I lived in New York. And he had tried to get me into Bitcoin when it was a dollar. And I said, this is like internet nerd money. I'm like a love revolutionary. I don't give a shit about this. And then he kept bothering me about it for years. And then it hit $1,400. And I was kind of humble enough to be like, well, if other people think it's worth something, I guess it is. But he had texted me and he said, listen, man, I want you to listen to this podcast. And it was the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast with Adam B. Levine and Andreas Antonopoulos. And so I had given up working in tech because my arms had given out. I was a programmer and designer for a very long time. And I had started making cannabis edibles in California because it seemed like an industry that was going to be pretty easy to get into. Like the marketing, the production, everything was shit and I was pretty good at it. So I had a girlfriend who was about four hours away, and I would go visit her on the weekends. So I threw the Bitcoin podcast on, I ate one of my candies, and—don't drive stoned, kids—but yeah, on the way there, I was listening and listening to the podcast and my brain kind of tuned in and I had what I can only describe as like a biblical vision. I would say like before that, I wouldn't have understood what that meant, but like just this massive data download into my head where I could basically see the future, like visually. I just saw the whole thing playing out in front of me. And I was like, oh shit. You know, Bitcoin, I'm still not particularly fascinated by, but the blockchain—this idea has an amazing amount of potential. And I kind of saw how it could help people coordinate. And so it just kind of struck me so much that I was like, I gotta go talk to Adam. I gotta go meet the people who did this podcast because at that time it was the only Bitcoin podcast. And I thought anybody who wanted attention for what they were doing would probably contact them. So the buddy that had told me to listen to the podcast randomly came into town three days later. And I said, hey man, I've been thinking a lot. I listened to the podcast. I have a lot of ideas. I need to meet Adam. And he goes, well, actually, I'm flying out in a couple of days to go meet him. We have a meeting scheduled. He's in Washington celebrating his birthday with his wife. And I said, no, no, no, no. We're getting in my car right now. I'm driving. I'm driving us there. I'm going. I'm going to go talk to him. And he's like, what, really? And I'm like, yeah, fucking cancel your ticket. Like we're getting in my car right now. So we drove like 20 hours or whatever to Washington State. I walked in pretty much—I don't know what their meeting was about—but I pretty much just took Adam to the side and we ended up sitting in his hot tub on his balcony for like nine hours just talking. And it was a really cool discussion. And I said, what I want from you is I want you to tell me anybody you know who's working on anything like this. And he said, well, do you know who Vitalik is? I said, man, I'm not in crypto. I'm not in Bitcoin. I don't know. I don't know anybody. I don't know anything. And he said, well, he just sent me this white paper a few days ago. I can forward it to you. Can you guys still hear me?

SPEAKER_06: Yep.

SPEAKER_03: So then, yeah, he forwarded me the white paper. I looked at it. You know, to me, it wasn't as comprehensive as the vision that I had, but I thought, you know, this is kismet, right? Like, what are the chances that all the stuff lined up like this? So I said, yeah, make the intro. And so we started a Skype group and, you know, Adam was there. I remember Charles was there. Vitalik was there. I was there. It became the official Ethereum Skype group and just kind of grew from there. So, you know, it was like...
