**[00:00] SPEAKER_03:** Can you hear me?

**[00:01] SPEAKER_01:** Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Excellent. Happy Strato Spaces. GM. What's up, guys? How are you? I'm good. First week of September. I'm not sure if it's officially the first week of fall, but nevertheless... Super excited for a new month. I know at Strato we have a very exciting month ahead.

**[00:17] SPEAKER_03:** I think technically fall starts on the 21st or 22nd, but spiritually it starts after Labor Day, of course. I don't know if anyone has a white suit, but I actually sort of have a white suit. And you can no longer wear those already.

**[00:29] SPEAKER_01:** I might have to see that. White suit's pretty nice.

**[00:32] SPEAKER_03:** I may have a photo. I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings, and that's the only time it's been. But I could probably dig one up for you, Jamie.

**[00:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Texture, you're welcome. We had him, we lost him. Give it a few more minutes for some more folks to pile in. Yeah, yeah, spiritually fall is here along with football to the behest of our European counterparts.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_03:** By the way, for Spaces resiliency, ChatGPT is recommending two co-hosts up front. Now, do we already have the two, or can you add another one?

**[01:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, you and Bob are co-hosts.

**[01:02] SPEAKER_03:** Okay, it just appears as speaker to me. Maybe it appears as co-host to Bob on Bob's side. Bob, are you a co-host successfully?

**[01:08] SPEAKER_00:** It appears so.

**[01:09] SPEAKER_03:** I see it now. Okay, fantastic.

**[01:11] SPEAKER_02:** Can you hear me? All right, cool.

**[01:13] SPEAKER_03:** Wait, very, very kind of cool August for those of us who spent some of it in New York. August is supposed to be hot, and it mostly wasn't. There's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall, but it feels like it kind of started early this year. I don't know what's going on.

**[01:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, completely agree. A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night. Cooler. You guys are old, been around, talking about the weather. We're waiting for you. Well, I'm here. Even better. Welcome. What's up? GM. Yeah, great to kick this off. I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just want to pay my compliments to your PFP, Texture. It's quite a good one. Thanks, man.

**[01:49] SPEAKER_02:** Do you own a Texture Punk?

**[01:51] SPEAKER_01:** I do not, but I saw a few folks with them and obviously noticed yours, so might have to get one.

**[01:56] SPEAKER_02:** It was a joke because I thought Punks were ugly. So I made myself a better one. And then a friend asked me to make her one, and then somebody else asked me to make one. And then like 30 people later, I was like, I should just fucking make a little thing where they can make their own. And then my buddy started a Discord and 10,000 people showed up and I was like, look.

**[02:14] SPEAKER_01:** That's some good lore.

**[02:15] SPEAKER_02:** That's some great lore right there. I thought it was going to be me and my hundred friends.

**[02:19] SPEAKER_00:** Accidental success. Fantastic.

**[02:21] SPEAKER_02:** Great.

**[02:22] SPEAKER_00:** All right. Well, let's get going. So hi, Texture. How are you?

**[02:25] SPEAKER_02:** It's been a while. It's been a long time.

**[02:27] SPEAKER_00:** Always good. When I think of you, the first thing I think of is love. Oh, and something I've spotted going through making my notes is your Medium is called Peace Love Revolution. Yes. So what's the story there?

**[02:39] SPEAKER_02:** So, you know, I was kind of—I wouldn't say a hippie. I didn't dress like a hippie. I didn't really hang out with hippies. But I took some psychedelics when I was a kid and I had some experiences. And, you know, it kind of drove my passion for doing good things and spreading love in the world. I know people that probably follow me are like, what the—he just calls people retards all day. Yeah, but I mean, I'm on Twitter. I don't know. It's full of retards. So I started this group called Peace Love Human because I was sitting in a shitty basement apartment in San Francisco and I was watching the news and I was seeing how religions got all fucked up. And I was like, what if there was a religion that didn't have any beliefs and we just went out and did nice shit? So for like three years of my life, I was just homeless and had no job and was setting up like free hug events and other stuff just to make people smile. Because making people feel loved or making people happy was not a quantifiable metric, but making people smile was. So that was what I did for my early 20s. So that's what I was doing, the community building. I accidentally started a cult. And when I realized that it was a cult, I shut it down.

**[03:42] UNKNOWN:** Okay.

**[03:43] SPEAKER_02:** But it helped me. It was my first foray into cult building, which obviously...

**[03:47] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Very useful.

**[03:48] SPEAKER_02:** I took into my role in Ethereum, and I feel like the Ethereum cult is going pretty well.

**[03:53] SPEAKER_00:** I seem to remember at some point you told me that you've probably hugged a thousand random people on the street.

**[03:58] SPEAKER_02:** Oh, a thousand in a day, probably. Probably a hundred thousand more. Yeah. It was nice. It was good. I mean, I could waste this entire thing telling that story. That's probably not what people want to hear.

**[04:08] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, I can see why Decentralized Dance Party also appealed to you on that score.

**[04:12] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, so DDP, Gary, the guy who runs that, he came and stayed at my apartment in Brooklyn. And we had this three-story loft in a warehouse, and we'd let people come crash. And he came through, and that's how I met him. And I've done three or four of them. I was... What is it? It's Tom. I was Tom. So Tom is like a rotate. I was Tom one time. So that was fun. I had to shave my beard. I had a mustache. I looked funny.

**[04:35] SPEAKER_00:** I'll drop some links on Twitter for that for anyone who hasn't seen Decentralized Dance Party, or you can go and have a Google on your own. It's quite exceptional.

**[04:42] SPEAKER_02:** It's funny. I had no...

**[04:43] SPEAKER_00:** Didn't really understand the decentralized thing at that point. I was not really involved. So he was kind of ahead of the curve on that with me for sure. So yeah, that's Gary Lachance, who was a fellow Vancouverite with me. He was, funnily enough, in a photo for the very first item I could find about Vancouver Decentral. You know, the whole Decentral Toronto/Vancouver thing. Gary was in that photo for the first one. Maybe well known as well now, but for DogeClaren. So there is the Doge-wrapped McLaren, which travels around many conferences where they can get financial support for that. Yeah, Gary's a great guy. It's pretty fun. So tell me about the vision that you had, which was then the same as the white paper. Because on the Twitter thread, I was wrongly saying your mind was blown by the Ethereum white paper, where actually what happened was that you'd had a vision of this about a week before, and then the white paper landed on your lap. So what the hell was that about?
