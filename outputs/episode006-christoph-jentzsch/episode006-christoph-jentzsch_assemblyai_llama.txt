SPEAKER_00: Okay, recording is in. Pro is in progress. It says so. Hello everybody. Today. Delighted to have Christoph Jentzsch with us. We did attempt to record this, Christoph and I, two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button. So we spoke for an hour or so and then it was not recorded. So this is round two. Hello Christoph, how are you?

SPEAKER_01: Hi everyone.

SPEAKER_02: Nice to meet you again. I'm doing good. I hope. You too. Thanks for the invitation.

SPEAKER_00: Fantastic. Christoph and I, our paths crossed for the first time way back in 2015 when I was trying to do C Ethereum on my smartwatch. And this was around the time that Christoph was. Was still at the. At the Ethereum Foundation. And then I think our cross paths have crossed a number of times since and. And Kieran's too.

SPEAKER_01: Indeed.

SPEAKER_00: So. So Christoph, what. What were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

SPEAKER_02: So in the journey started in 2013. I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics actually about self organizing systems. So like biology, six months in mathematical biology and other things. So I was studying systems which have local rules and global behavior and I came across Bitcoin, which has just a small set of local rules and a global behavior as a currency. And. But the, the reason I came across this was I was looking for cheap GPUs like graphic cards and the bitcoin miners were selling their GPU mining rigs to get some FPGAs and later AS6. And so that's how I got into what's bitcoin mining. And so I bought my first bitcoin, got into this bubble, did read everything I could about it and then I came across the white paper From Vitalik, early 2014, something like January, February in some bitcoin forum somewhere. And I was already totally in love with the idea of Bitcoin being a decent currency and all the characteristics and features of it. And this white paper of Vitalik, and if you read it again, it's almost a prophecy, except of NFTs. Everything is in there from DAOs, from ENS, like names, domain name systems and all of that. So for me it opened up this option of building applications with the same characteristics as Bitcoin, but just not a currency but everything else. And so then I started reading everything about it. And in 2000, actually still 2014, in summer, I read the crowd sale was in 2014. Right, right, yeah, the crowd sale. So around the time the crowd sale happened, I read did watch a video from Gavin woods. He was somewhere in the Scandinavics some conference there. The Nordics and he talked about Ethereum. I loved it. And he said, you want to open up an office in berlin looking for C plus plus developers. I was a C plus plus developer so in territory physics it's 90 software development. So I said well I want to do this. So I took my parental leave time plus some vacation time from and passed my PhD for like three or six months and said I will return after I'm done. I thought this is just a short project because they raised money maybe six, maybe maybe 12 months, 18 months or so, then it's over. When I started I thought about maybe three to six months and then I go back to my PhD. So I work there with Ethereum is Kevin Wood was a great time and then just decided to stay. Was so exciting.

SPEAKER_00: So. So you never got to be a doctor?

SPEAKER_02: No, I'm not a doctor. I did not finish my PhD, although I only had six months left which was kind of a pity. I worked like for three years on that and. But I also had at the time, I think four or five kids. I needed some money. I didn't get much money as a PhD student so I did software development as a side hustle basically. And so when I got this project I said well let's do this for two or three months as a parent believe time and then I can return. And then I decided to really interrupt my PhD is that I will maybe return one year later because I thought the foundation will eventually run out of money because they're not making any profits, they just raised donations, then they will spend them and then it's over. Then I can continue my PhD. That was originally a plan, just came different.

SPEAKER_00: I mean I guess it's never too late, right.

SPEAKER_02: I actually sometimes think about if I should return. It's just so much to learn again I'm right now doing tokenize it. I'm basically working on tokenizing German companies. It works, works very well. So currently I'm not planning on getting back anytime soon.

SPEAKER_00: No, because I mean famously you had, you know, Dr. Gavin Wood and Dr. Christian Wrightweisner as well and I think, I think there were a couple of other PhDs as well.

SPEAKER_02: There was definitely.

SPEAKER_01: I also dropped out of mine. I was actually in mathematical physics too. Interesting similar background.

SPEAKER_02: It's actually the same like theoretical physics. It's the mathematical part of physics. I enjoyed it very much. I did thermodynamics and statistics mostly. Software development was really fun.

SPEAKER_01: Well, by the way, Jim is trying to join. I don't know there's anything that needs Happening he gets some browser.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, well he'll pop up and we can add him or if he's. Then never mind. So Christoph in terms of getting hired into fdev and I'm sorry if I just missed it. So how, how did that happen? Did you meet Gav at a meetup? Did you say?

SPEAKER_02: Yes, I actually, I listen only to his talk as for the online thing and I actually just wrote him an email, said look, I see this last developer would love to join Ethereum, love what you're doing. And he invited me to meet me in Kreuzberg Berlin, so which again is about two hours drive from here. So I went up there, met him. I remember the. I was in his name again wrote the book also about Ethereum. Did Lexus from IBM. Yeah, I think he was also there just as an example of some people who are like reading about Ethereum. Interested in joining.

SPEAKER_00: Of course Roman as well, right? Roman. Roman was there with the Java client.

SPEAKER_02: But it was mostly developers. But also I think Stefan to all was already there. So we had already the London team. So it was like an internal Ethereum meeting. Kind of a meetup. Almost. Almost. I think three days or so. I don't know exactly five days even. So it was a full week. I was there for the full week as far as I can remember. I did a presentation about testing how the test suite is very important. Yes, we had to remix projects. Solidity Project I think mostly started during the time Gavin used this for a explaining his vision of what Ethereum as a platform for decentralized application. So building Swarm. I don't know if Swarm and Risper was already launched there but at least like the generic idea, the MIS browser. So all those ideas are really sketched out there like the technical roadmap. What we are going to build because we started just of course with the basic clients like implementing the protocol. But he took it like kind of what are we going to do in the next 12 months building the Mist browser, like remix of those tools to have a platform for decentralized applications. I remember one slide which I think I posted on Twitter a while ago, but you have those three circles, one circle is one node and you would see like they are connecting on the blockchain using Swarm for the data, whisper for the messages. And you like this whole picture was painted there and the people attending, I think around 50 people plus minus 10, don't know exact number where mostly developers talking about code coding there. Joseph, I remember him being there saying well all of you, you will create your own companies becoming millionaires. I remember CH was talking about that and I think mostly was he was right. So most of those people in the room in one way or another co founded, founded or early part of companies building on top of Ethereum in the years to come.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Let me see if I can do a little, a little screen share. No, never mind. I can't work out how not. Not to worry.

SPEAKER_01: But, but yeah, this is present button. So not working.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't see that. Is that on the right hand side.

SPEAKER_01: Somewhere or at the bottom you maybe have a different. For me, I appear on the top right and below and to the right of me below there's a present button.

SPEAKER_00: Right. With like a plus post maybe. Never mind, never mind. I was just going to show the iconic photo of people at DEVCON 0. Right. You know that's this big group shot with nearly everyone who was out there, you know. So that's a classic Ethereum photo. So I was looking, Sorry, there's like 11 of the videos are still around from Devcon Zero. I think there were about 20 sessions. I'm still trying to dig out the others. Some of them, including yours, I have not managed to find yet.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was only about the test suite, how it build it, how people would use it. It was rather technical. There was not much of a vision in there.

SPEAKER_00: Well, left terrorist presented on Emacs so you're not the most boring talk.

SPEAKER_02: Again. It was just the nerds starting also for most of them. The first time we actually met, of course the C team, they didn't know each other because they're working in the co working space Left Terrace and others were there. But then let's say I think it was the first time I actually met Vitalik because he came there then of Course Jeffrey and his team, Stefan's team, Joseph Lubin. So it was for me it was the first time to meet all of them and having talks and since we really had time, five days, a small group of people, we actually do have time to eat together to talk. So it was not so crowded maybe as defcon is today. Very intimate. Was good.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: I mean one thing I can't quite remember. So there was a time there was an Ethereum slack that was kind of open to the public. There were a lot of people. The sort of Ethereum affiliation status was fairly vague at that point. And we were, you know I, I remember we were using Skype a lot in those days. Just, just the team and like Vitalik like to Skype. And then at some point I sort of lost the thread of like where the core like I can't remember where the core development discussions were happening. And I'll maybe I'll ask Jim to comment also. Just like those tests we kept like getting them and I think I'm thinking of some a little bit earlier on and we'd build them and Jim was mostly working on them and would update on the like passing percentage which would always be between like 93 and 98 and then something would change, you know. But yet like where did the discussion? Because yeah, between like sale and devcon0 I think it kind of got a little bit. It like moved around where the dev discussion.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was mostly Skype. We also had Skype channels for almost everything like the C team and so on. Then I, in a short time they used a. It was a note taker which had a name also with E something. Yeah. Ether pad, something like this. Right. There were some notes being written there but the communication was really I would say 99% Skype for me. Later on we used a tool based on GitHub. What was the name of it? Gitter came later. This was like the replacement for Skype. But I didn't use it too much. This was actually during the time and I was actually leaving but it was done used also by C. There you had a channel per GitHub repo. This was during the time that GitHub was completely reorganized because at the beginning was like one big repo is everything they made sub modules was so messy. And during those, during this process we got Gitter. But yeah, for me it was mostly Skype.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And. And then annoyingly that kind of means a lot of these early discussions are kind of like a bit lost because nobody is is using Skype and Skype is getting like deleted. This is happening in February of next year.

SPEAKER_01: Oh, I thought it happened already.

SPEAKER_00: It's no, you can still request to download and I did and then I haven't heard anything back and want to do that to see if I can get some of those. So everybody apply to download your. Your Skype data. I remember the with, with Gitter there was a discussion about this that I was involved with at the EF later which was saying the problem with Skype is it wasn't discoverable. You know, you had to add. You had to request to be added, but you had to know what was there to be able to do that request. So it was a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Whereas Gitter, it was like a one to one with the repositories. So if you're using a repo. There you go. There's a one to one channel with that. And it was discoverable and archived. But then Slack I think was even earlier. So. Oh, there was the forum as well. Right? It was an Ethereum forum too.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was important. And then Slack. I think I got introduced to Slack by Stefan Tual when he created a community for the dao. When he looked for a new communication tool, he went with Slack. And at that time it was not like today like a business tool for the company. It was really communities. Like we had 5,000 people in our Slack, which is not how it's used today.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. So welcome Jim. Your technical problem.

SPEAKER_03: Hi.

SPEAKER_02: Sorry.

SPEAKER_03: I had some technical problems for a while there, but I don't know, I'm just listening to you guys. What, what, what happened that brought the whole world to Zoom? Suddenly.

SPEAKER_01: It was in waves look for on my side.

SPEAKER_03: I don't know, I just. I just woke up one day and everything was Zoomed.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. From then on species like a statistical phase transition, you know. I think it was. It was two faces. I would always get invited to corporate like, let's say 2017 to 2019 when I was doing primarily BD. I found that I would get invited to any of 10 video conferencing tools. And like what is the Cisco one was the WebEx. That was horrible. I would get that a lot. Google meetings didn't feel sufficiently corporate or something even though it was okay. And Zoom had the best quality for a while. And I found that everyone picked Zoom at the same time. Like mid 2018, let's say.

SPEAKER_00: I think it was just quality to me. Like I mean Microsoft really fumbled. Right. Skype had got such a lead for so long. But Zoom Just seemed more reliable. Whatever weird little proprietary magic they had going on.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: And then I guess, yeah, I guess I was under the impression that like Zoom is for businesses.

SPEAKER_01: I think that's. Well that is true, but it was just that still, I mean this, this has gotten way better in the last 10 years, but still nothing really works for reliable video over the. The Internet. It's, it's just much better than, than what existed. But there was a free version always and they would just like time you out. So like they had a fairly viral acquisition loop where like. And I was just gonna say in the pandemic once when people were locked down, it became a consumer tool where people would have like yard large yoga classes or you know, sermons or whatever with like 500 people on a Zoom and then everyone bald.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I remember it well. All of a sudden like my, my parents were like calling me up and they're like, we found this awesome new tool. You probably never heard of it, it's called Zoom.

SPEAKER_01: But yeah, there were like 10.

SPEAKER_00: Let's move on from sharing about video platforms, eh? So, so I look back, so, so Jim's first commits on. On the Haskell client were mid September 2020 14. So you know, a couple of months ahead of, ahead of devcon zero that you'd had the yellow paper for, for, for, for. For five months at that time. And I, I did find on our Slack, you know, a bit of a thread where, where things I think from you Kristoff, were. Were being discussed by Jim. I don't know. Did you guys interact directly at all on. On testing Jim Christoph?

SPEAKER_02: Not directly, not as far as I can remember. I mean maybe there were some messages. I mean it's about. It has been a while ago.

SPEAKER_03: I could be wrong. I may have met you briefly in London when we had that conference, but it would have been like, like high, you know, quick, quick greetings at a part, you know, an after party or something.

SPEAKER_02: I mean 10 years ago, lots of people. Sure. We were the testing GitHub repo and we had all the major clients using it and I was interacting mostly asking responding questions. I mean of course the C time I was super close to. I used the C client also to pre fill the tests. So this was per default. Right, except we found there was a test failing but it should. But actually C was wrong. So sometimes this happened. The test was not really fading, just C was wrong. But in the maturity of cases C was right. We were just having those conversations and we found tons of issues not just in the Beginning I wrote those tests using actually bytecode, the very first test. Then I went to a low level Lisp like language. This was lll, this was the precursor to Solidity by Gavin. Then in the end actually I had automated fast testing where I wrote software that would create thousands of tests and we had some aws like over a hundred cores of machines constantly creating tests and we had always some failing on some versions of Gas or other clients. So this was mostly what I did during one and a half years.

SPEAKER_00: Right, right. So I mean I guess for the, for the viewers, something that Ethereum chose to do differently from Bitcoin was to have this specification separate from the client software. Right. So you know, when Bitcoin started it was the code that happened first and the, the white paper afterwards. But, but the white paper wasn't a protocol specification. So you know Gav was doing that yellow paper spec in parallel with the C client which was sort of the, the first one. While you have Vitalik working on the Python client, Jeff working on the GO internally. But then you've got all these other clients as well. The Java one by Roman I think started in about April or May ourselves. Jim and Kieran here with a Haskell client starting in September. You had JavaScript as well.

SPEAKER_02: It's more like a library. I don't know if it's really like a syncing client, but they have all the tools so you can in your web app kind of integrates part of parts of it to verify certain states.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean I think maybe they had a sinking client at some point apart from it obviously like couldn't actually keep up but theoretical and, and yeah, like a little later there was a Ruby client as well. And yeah, at one point there were eight different clients.

SPEAKER_02: Right. If you want to, I can tell the story of why we all are using Guest today. Yeah, absolutely. Not a given. At the time, of course everyone had different opinions, but the C client was really the fastest, the most solid one, passing all the tests and so on. But Gavin always wanted to add new features, do a refactoring and he was a perfectionist, which is not bad for this kind of software. And then the time came for the security audit because everybody wants to launch Ethereum now and we said before we launch it, those clients needs to be have a proper security audit by an external company. And one of the companies doing this was Deja Vu in Seattle. So I actually went revisit team for the audit and because Gavin wanted to build some more features, said well let's Just Guess can go first. Let's first audit the GO client. They are done. I'm done with the the features I want to build and then we going into the audit for the C client. So G was audited picked. They had some issues, they fixed the issues and now it's time. And so there was technically no reason why not. Well actually we could launch Ethereum now and we have a fully audited client. Testnet is running for a while, no major issues, no fading tests for a long time. So why would we wait for the C client to be audited? And I mean they all really had the pressure of money was running out. We need to launch now. So and then the decision was made, let's launch with ga. They can still use C. It's just not audited. Let's say in two months or so the audit is done and then they can use C even more if they want. So. But then the big mistake was in my view when they made this announcement of you can start now. They recommended using Geth because it was the audited one. So almost everybody run Guest. This was like we started with almost 100% guess and then I was just a minor. Other clients use it only very few did use them. And so after the audit was done, nobody switched for like sure. But Guess is running I'm synced like what's the issue? Why should I switch? And so we had this 1910 or 1820 distribution. It just stayed like this. So if Gavin would have been either say let's just do the audit now and we just. If both audited then Step maybe would have 5050 or even the other way around if they would have first added the Z plus plus and Ethereum would have been launched without a Guest audit. Like we would have seen a total switch. And then of course money was going low in the foundation. They had to reduce the team. And because Guest was the most used ones, there were some issues with Gavin. Another story, maybe you have a talk with him. And so in the end Ming decided to basically kick out the complete C. This was then in shortly before defcon won. So something like November, October, ish. So but yeah, I think the reason for that was also C time wasn't really that used. Also there are other reasons as well, but you can see how a tiny thing can have such big consequences down the road. Like him doing polkadot today and all of that. And it was great. I mean I really, I still think I said maybe would have group steak and sharding way earlier. If Gavin would have stayed so without him they moved slower. That of course the price went up, there were more security relevant things. So changes happened. Not quickly anymore, but take more time and so on. But I think this was a big loss for Ethereum that Gavin left basically in 2015.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

SPEAKER_01: The client side was the cause, I think it was part of it. But it, you know, having the process maybe started with the Red Wedding which we discussed in some other early days of Ethereum episodes like he, I remember very clearly in the room like you know, two weeks into my Ethereum tenure at that time that he was talking about brain drain if it was only going to be a non profit foundation and not going to have a commercial arm.

SPEAKER_02: Yes, there were more issues with that definitely like this was not the deciding part but it was like those things were adding up. I remember that Gavin had this idea of turning the foundation into a DAO and then having for profit entity next to it which would build things and make money. So there were many different commercial ideas at the time. So he then basically started on his own East Core. I remember he wanted to have me as part of it but I decided to do slock it at the time. So that's why I did not became a co founder of East Core. Another story we can go into this, we want you know, you know what happened after that. But there's many reasons we're part of it. I think also him and Ming didn't really get along too much. There was not really a trust relationship going on. Of course, money running out, different visions of how Ethereum should evolve technically and economically if you want all played a role. But I think it was just one part that the C client wasn't really used that much. And the reason for that was guests being audited, launching without an audit for the C client.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean talking about Gavin, the features. So yeah, there was a ton of stuff on that, on that C team. Aleph. Aleph Z0 as well. And Alth 1. So Alth 1 being the GUI miner then. I know. How would you describe Alice 0.

SPEAKER_02: Kind of first interface to the blockchain in some way like the first graphical interface to a blockchain client. And what could it do? Of course you could mine, you could deploy a smart contract, you could visit, make it visible somewhat what's happening there. It was not really end user friendly in any way, but it was just a replacement of what people just do on the command line usually command line, run your client some input, have some output. And it was the first kind of graphical use interface. Graphical use interface replacing the command line.

SPEAKER_00: I guess it's sort of like a combination of like what you have with the block explorer now apart from it. That's, that's like a view only. And this was both of you and a, and a. And a do.

SPEAKER_02: Yep.

SPEAKER_00: But yeah, those, those GUI clients so.

SPEAKER_02: Much, much more influential than the misprouser. The Mist browser. I think there's a video by Alex van der Sander, it's like a 10 minute video on YouTube. They had this prototype not working yet, but just like take, take it until you make it. The vision of the Mist browser and, and this also really made us understand how Ethereum could work for the end user. Having different identities connected to wallets and you would load those steps with a IPFS hash or over Swarm. One day the app was loading and you could do some finance stuff there. This gave us an idea of what Ethereum could be. It was. So you have to think Vitalik gave us a rather technical vision and broad intellectual thing. But Gavin gave us this pro Internet vision. Alexander gave us this very concrete thing what an end user could do with that in the next six to 12 months maybe. That's very important.

SPEAKER_00: Just yesterday actually. So there was, there was an announcement from Uniswap about them sort of turning on fees and doing various things that more kind of to do with, you know, the company and the protocol time together. And I saw a reaction to that saying, you know, well I'm never going to, you know, I'm never going to use this again. You know, you can't like, you know, extract ongoing revenue out of a protocol and, and this person then said it's time for Mist 2.

SPEAKER_02: Totally. I've said this before, we need the.

SPEAKER_00: Full vision so that you've got hosted and the apps and you don't need a server and you don't need a company and you can just make this pure, you know, immutable smart contract wrapped, wrapped in a UI that's, that's all decentralized. You think we can have a miss too.

SPEAKER_02: I would love to see this. I heard people think about this before. I don't know if anybody really started the project, but should be totally doable today. It's not rocket science, you know.

SPEAKER_01: Let me interject. We ourselves have made different attempts at this where you just download the app from the chain itself pretty much it worked fine. I guess it just wasn't as much differentiator. It made things a little slower to do it this way all the time. I also think one of the people that took the Web three the world computer vision sort of seriously was like the Internet computer people. And I don't know anyone that uses Internet computer but like the every once in a while I see tweets about it and I'm like that sounds great. Yeah, serve the app from the chain. You know, it's got some cool like smart contracting language in it and I guess there's just no demand if it like slows the app down even slightly. And I think MetaMask and then many other wallets were sort of enough. Still not the whole thing, but.

SPEAKER_02: But yeah, I guess it's like you.

SPEAKER_01: Got to get people to use it if you want it to be maximally cypherpunk too.

SPEAKER_02: I fully agree. And I mean, yeah, the problem with this is you only need it if you really need it. Meaning if Uniswap failed, the interface is not there. It's like a backup, but it's not what you want to use daily. And if you remember, maybe Cure you have Defcon1. When they presented MetaMask, my first thought was oh, this is totally away from the vision. Like how can you not run a full node? How can you dare? You like to just serve over RPCs and fora like almost. No, not a scam, but it was not what we intended to build today. It's like this is a decentralized version of it. This is like non custodial metamask or the good guys compared to all the others. See how the view shifted over the years. Then it was absolutely required to run a full node if the MIS browser. This is how it's done. And now we have Metamask and Fora and today this is really the version which is viewed as the original non custodial Ethereum vision. So how things are shifting basically. But yes, you only need those things if things are falling apart. Just as an example, so many people use the nosis safe. Let's say the nosis safe UI is gone. Technically it shouldn't be a problem to run another one, but it really needs to be something on IPFS that needs to be something which can self host so I can still access my wallet without going to the command line. So for those reasons you need it. And the mispronoun was sort of as the fallback for every depth. Like of course you can have your application run on a normal.com domain on. On AWS. Fine. But if you could serve the same app in a decentralized fashion as a backup, this would be great because you could still use it if the company that's a uni swap, the company fails if someone builds a nice Uniswap UI served by IPFS directly interacting with the smart contracts.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's fair. Also, I mean Uniswap I think is controversial. I know Jim wanted to say something controversial because they had the company level fee skim and then so I think they've turned the on chain fee on. I don't know that they've turned the company fee off. I haven't read that for detail.

SPEAKER_00: I believe so because one of the replies was saying okay, so how are your like shareholders gonna like that?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay, fair enough. Well hopefully they hold a bunch of the, the uni and it will, you know, mark to market.

SPEAKER_00: They're doing a bunch of burn so that you know, it should be to the benefit of all stakeholders. But yeah, just sort of this interesting kind of contrast, right between completely immutable, you know, force of nature smart contracts versus you know, more permission, more tied to a company more sort of like wanting to have fees for maintenance kind of kind of question. I mean again, you know, it's like Treasuries I guess either.

SPEAKER_02: But this opens up the questions how should an Ethereum app be built economically? And this is also a question being answered during that time this was being the DAO was one approach of should be fully on chain, all the revenue should be on chain. There should be no for profit entity directly attached to it and slock it. The company I built after that would be a service provider for them, getting paid by them for work being done. For the DAO for one version I was always skeptical and still am about companies where you have effectively two cap tables, meaning you have a token cap table if you want. Of course it's a utility token, governance token and so on, but effectively its kind of ownership in the protocol and then you have a for profit company with shareholders and this is always, I think very dangerous because you don't know where to go into what's, where's the value and the shares of the company or on the token. This was the main reason all those companies had those nonprofit foundations in Switzerland, rightfully so, because they said you only want to have one cap table. Like the Ethereum Foundation. There was no shareholders of Ethereum, there was a nonprofit foundation and a token. The token, if you want to have a share in the economic success of the protocol, you would buy Ether. And so later on there were many other token projects where they had a non profit foundation. So no shareholders, no second cap table. And then you would have only the token and all the value would be there. And now with Uniswap you have this problem of having again shareholders and tokens. I think that's dangerous and not a good idea actually.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. So perhaps let's talk about actually just before we get to DEFCON 1. So the launch, right? So obviously a lot of testing and coordination and this different series of proof of concepts. So I mean how did you know it was good enough? Like what was that testing flow and collaboration?
