SPEAKER_00: Okay. Recording is in progress, it says. So hello, everybody. Today, delighted to have Christophe with us. We did attempt to record this, Christophe and I, two weeks ago, but I forgot to press the record button. So we spoke for an hour or so, and then it was not recorded. So this is round two.

SPEAKER_01: So hello, Christophe. How are you? Hi, Bob. Nice to meet you again. I'm doing good. I hope you too. Thanks for the invitation.

SPEAKER_00: Fantastic. Yeah. So Christophe and I, you know, our paths crossed for the first time way back in 2015, when I was trying to do C++ Ethereum on my smartwatch. This was around the time that Christophe was still at the Ethereum Foundation. And then I think I crossed paths a number of times since.

SPEAKER_00: So, Christophe, what were you doing with your life before you found Ethereum and joined this crazy journey?

SPEAKER_01: So the journey actually started in 2013. I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics, actually about self-organizing systems—so, like, biology, six months in mathematical biology and other things. I was studying systems which have local rules and global behavior. And I came across Bitcoin, which has just a small set of local rules and a global behavior as a currency. The reason I came across this was I was looking for cheap GPUs, like graphics cards. And the Bitcoin miners were selling their GPU mining rigs to get some FPGAs and later ASICs. And so that's how I got into Bitcoin mining. I bought my first Bitcoin, got into this bubble, read everything I could about it, and then I came across the white paper from Ethereum early 2014, January or February, in some Bitcoin forum somewhere. I was already totally in love with the idea of Bitcoin being a decent currency and all the characteristics and features of it. And this white paper of Vitalik—I mean, if you read it again, it's almost a prophecy. Except for NFTs, everything's in there—from DAOs, from ENS, like names as domain names as terms, and all of that. So for me, it opened up this option of building applications with the same characteristics as Bitcoin, but just not a currency—everything else. So then I started reading everything about it. And in 2014, in summer—the crowdsale was in 2014, right? Yeah, the crowdsale. So around the time the crowdsale happened, I watched a video from Gavin Wood. He was somewhere in the Nordics, some conference there, and he talked about Ethereum. I loved it. And he said he wanted to open up an office in Berlin looking for C++ developers. I was a C++ developer. So in theoretical physics, it's 90% software development. So I said, well, I want to do this. So I took my parental leave time plus some vacation time and paused my PhD for like three or six months and said, I will return after I'm done. I thought this was just a short project because they raised money—maybe six, maybe twelve months, eighteen months or so, then it's over. When I started, I thought about maybe three to six months, and then I go back to my PhD. So I worked there with Ethereum. This is Gavin Wood. It was a great time. And then I just decided to stay. It was so exciting.

SPEAKER_00: So you never got to be a doctor?

SPEAKER_01: No, I'm not a doctor. I did not finish my PhD, although I only had six months left, which was kind of a pity. I worked for three years on that. But I also had, at the time, I think four or five kids and needed some money. I didn't get much money as a PhD student, so I did some software development as a side hustle, basically. And so when I got this project, I said, well, let's do this for two or three months as a parental leave time, and then I can return. And then I decided to really interrupt my PhD. I said I will maybe return one year later because I thought the foundation would eventually run out of money because they're not making any profits. They just raised donations, then they will spend them, then it's over. Then I can continue my PhD. That was originally the plan. Just came different.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, I guess it's never too late, right?

SPEAKER_01: I actually sometimes think about it, if I should return. It's just so much to learn again. I'm right now doing Tokenize It. I'm basically working on tokenizing German companies. It works very well. So currently, I'm not planning on getting back anytime soon.

SPEAKER_00: No, because, I mean, famously, you had, you know, Dr. Gavin Wood and Dr. Christian as well. And I think there were a couple of other PhDs as well. There was. Definitely.

SPEAKER_02: I also dropped out of mine. I was actually in mathematical physics too. Interesting, similar background.

SPEAKER_01: It's actually the same. Theoretical physics is the mathematical part of physics. I tried very much. I did thermodynamics and statistics, mostly software development. It was really fun.

SPEAKER_02: Well, by the way, Jim is trying to join. I don't know if there's anything that needs happening. He has some browser issue.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Well, he'll pop up and we can add him. Or if he's—I'll see. Then never mind. So, Christophe, in terms of getting hired into Ethereum dev—and I'm sorry if I just missed it—so how did that happen? Did you meet Gavin at a meetup, did you say?

SPEAKER_01: Yes. Actually, no. I listened only to his talk. It was an online thing. I actually just wrote him an email. Said, look, I would love to join with you. I love what you're doing. And he invited me to meet him in Kreuzberg, Berlin, which again is about a two-hour drive from here. So I went up there, met him. I remember the first conversation, he was talking about all the stuff they were gonna build and said, well, what can you do? And I just asked him, what's the most complicated stuff you have right now? Like, give me a complicated task. I somehow can figure it out. So he talked about the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which needed some testing. So I just picked working on testing the Ethereum Virtual Machine or writing tests for it. Back at the time, I actually had no real idea what he was talking about. Meaning, of course, I did understand on the white paper level. I did understand what Ethereum was about. But Gavin had this skill of writing the Yellow Paper, which is still incredible work. It's such a great specification, different from Bitcoin, really having a specification so multiple clients could be built. In there, he defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine. And I think I read the paper six, seven times. I felt like I was one out of, I don't know, 10 or 20 people in the world at the time who really understood the Yellow Paper. I did corrections to it. I have some pull requests actually in the Yellow Paper GitHub repo, added missing definitions and stuff like that. And then what I mostly did was writing tests according to the specification, which then were—with the help of the C++ client, because this was his team—so I was working also on the C++ codebase. And so Geth, PyEthereum, also the JavaScript version, and what else did you have? Like, Haskell client and others. They were basically using my tests to see if they implemented the machine, also the state transitions and block creation, correctly.
