**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. We are live, and we have a very special episode today. We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crain. Welcome, John Crain.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_01:** Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone. Hey. Good to see you guys. Thanks for having me.

**[00:09] SPEAKER_00:** John Crain, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of SuperRare. But do you wanna give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

**[00:17] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, sure. So, yeah, let's see. My crypto journey started in around 2015, going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there. Before that, my background is kind of in art and technology. I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad. And, yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were gonna intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just things that were a little bit past finance and trading. And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for digital art. So, yeah, I doubled down immediately.

**[00:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Remember...

**[00:53] SPEAKER_03:** How you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally? Obviously, we met there, but, like, what was that—yeah. Well? Your—yeah.

**[00:58] SPEAKER_01:** So I was kinda hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd. I had actually met, I think, John—which I forgot—but I met him at the New York Bitcoin Center. I don't know if you guys remember that.

**[01:07] SPEAKER_00:** Yep. We do.

**[01:08] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So I was hanging around, and actually, I was super into Counterparty. So I was very much like, Ethereum's too complicated. You know, Vitalik's full of shit. It's not gonna work. And then the network launched, and I was like, okay, I was wrong. Like, this is actually super cool. I have no problem changing. I was like, I was totally wrong. This is amazing. And I was just googling Ethereum blockchain hackathon. I was trying to find, like, get deeper involved. I was trying to quit my day job and go full-time crypto. And so then I think I just googled it, and it was like, oh shit, there's this hackathon in two weeks, and I applied with Charles. And then, yeah, met you guys.

**[01:42] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And to be clear, to let everyone know, we were blown away by you and your brother Charles' project, and we gave you, I think, your first job—both of you—in Web3. Right?

**[01:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Exactly.

**[01:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I think—

**[01:53] SPEAKER_01:** I think the Monday after—I don't know. I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full-time on BlockApps.

**[01:59] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Well, I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were—

**[02:02] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

**[02:03] SPEAKER_02:** I remember there was, like, a couple week consulting—

**[02:05] SPEAKER_03:** Transition period while—

**[02:06] SPEAKER_01:** You know? Yeah. I think that's true. Yeah. Maybe it was, like, we started hourly, like, getting to know each other a little bit and then full-time. So yeah.

**[02:13] SPEAKER_02:** So with Counterparty, you could have been on—

**[02:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Exactly.

**[02:16] SPEAKER_00:** If only. So what inspired SuperRare? Like, I know when you were working with us, you kind of became our head of product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations. But what triggered you to create SuperRare, which is, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the first NFT platforms really out there?

**[02:33] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, it was super interesting. Right? We were all kind of on the ground floor at the ConsenSys office—or at least me and Kieran were hanging out there. And watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating. Me and Kieran talked a bunch about ERC-20 tokens, and I found it super interesting that it was this very small bit of standard—like, it's a super simple protocol, very simple code—but the adoption created this massive wealth generation. And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for humans and the economy. It was incredible to see that happen. And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-721, and I saw the CryptoPunks launch. And I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy. If you think about the consumer web, it's all an image and a title tag and some metadata. So it could be that the entire consumer web turns into NFTs. I don't know exactly what the business model is gonna look like, but the total addressable market is probably pretty large. So that got me into NFTs. And then on the flip side of that, I was also kinda in and around the New York art scene, going to the art fairs. I had friends who were looking for gallery representation and kinda part of the business of art. And it just seemed obvious. I was like, oh, there's now a way to truly own digital assets, and this is obviously gonna apply to digital art. So it's kinda like the marriage of my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.

**[03:48] SPEAKER_00:** And what was it like to be at the forefront of the NFT explosion? Because you guys—like, I know for a long time you were building, and it was like, oh, how's it going? And no one was really paying attention. And all of a sudden, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

**[04:01] SPEAKER_01:** It was absolutely crazy. It was just completely surreal the whole time. It felt like a dream. We started in 2018. We tried to raise money. It never really worked. By the time we raised, we were already cash flow positive and making more than we were paying ourselves.

**[04:15] SPEAKER_00:** That's the best situation to possibly be.

**[04:17] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. It was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea. So it was a grind. It was super volatile. Many times I was just like, what am I doing with my life? But then it just really started. I remember the numbers were doubling every month for a while. I remember it was October 2020. It was our first million-dollar month in volume, and I was just like, this is wild. Because twelve months ago, we were like, alright, so the volume was $5,000, and we made a couple hundred dollars.

**[04:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And were you guys the first self-minting NFT platform? I think we were trying to talk about that, actually.

**[04:51] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. We were the first to combine—like, I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools—but we were the first to combine the minting and the marketplace experience. There weren't great minting tools then. So we started with the minting tool, and then we were like, alright, I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll build the marketplace too. And it was partially just out of necessity because the tooling sucked at the time.

**[05:12] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. It's funny because I remember, if you recall, what later became the Flow guys doing CryptoKitties. They were based in Vancouver, and I was talking to them about running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time. But, I mean, you've done so much. One of the amazing things is the launch of the RARE token, and you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to figuring out DAO governance in reality. What led to that, and how did that go? What did you figure out there?

**[05:41] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I mean, early on, part of what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where the users of the networks also participate in the upside of the network. There’s the "Fat Protocol" article that was super popular in 2016. So just thinking about what monetization looks like, and can you build platforms that are more collaborative than extractive? Where it's like, if you're Meta, you're just going to extract as much metadata and sell ads—which is a great business. But partially, for me, it was almost like a thought experiment of, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads and it could be a marketplace as the business model, and then it's collective ownership via the token? So yeah, I was drinking a lot of the crypto Kool-Aid at the time.

**[06:23] SPEAKER_03:** Did you do it classic ICO style? Was there a fixed price auction? How did the RARE get in there?

**[06:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. We actually just did a huge airdrop. Probably one of our mistakes. We should've probably sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away. And yeah, there's plenty of challenges. DAOs are hard to manage and run. But it's cool to see the current administration change tack and actually seem like they're interested in building and pushing forward.
