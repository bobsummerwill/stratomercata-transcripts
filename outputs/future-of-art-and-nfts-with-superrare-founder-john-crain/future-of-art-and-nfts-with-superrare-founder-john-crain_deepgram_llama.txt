SPEAKER_00: Okay. We are live, and we have a very special episode today. We are talking about the future of art and NFTs, and we're joined by special guest and very old friend, John Crane. Welcome, John Crane. Hey, Victor. Hey, everyone. Hey. Good to see you guys. Thanks for having me. John Crane, of course, as everyone knows, is the founder of Super Rare. But do wanna give a quick intro for anyone who is not intimately familiar with all the amazing things you've done over the past couple of years?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Sure. So, yeah, I let's see. My crypto journey started in around 2015, going to the ConsenSys hackathon where I met, at least, you know, three of the other folks on this call there. Yeah. I was you know, before that, my background is kind of in art and technology. I worked in advertising. I studied architecture and structural engineering for undergrad. And, yeah, I was always really interested in when crypto and blockchain were gonna, you know, intersect more with kind of the consumer tech and just, you know, things that were, a little bit past, you know, finance and trading. And so, yeah, when I saw NFTs, it was an instant win for, digital art. So, yeah, it doubled down immediately.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Remember

SPEAKER_03: how you heard about the hackathon or Ethereum generally? Obviously, we met there, but, like, what was that Yeah. Well? Your yeah.

SPEAKER_01: So I was I was kinda hanging out with the New York Bitcoin crowd. I see. Act yeah. I had actually met, I think, John, which I forgot, but I met him at the, like, the New York Bitcoin Center. I don't know if you guys remember that. Yep. We do. Yeah. Yeah. So I was hanging around, and, actually, I was, like I was super into counterparty, so I was very much like, Ethereum's too complicated. You know, Metallic's full of shit. It's not gonna work. And then the network launched, and I was like, okay. I was wrong. Like, this is actually super cool. Like, you know, I have no problem changing. I was like, I was totally wrong. This is amazing. And I was just, like, googling Ethereum blockchain hackathon. I was, like, trying to find, like, get deeper involved. You know, I was trying like, quit my day job and go full time crypto. And so then I I think I just googled it, and it was like, oh, shit. There's this hackathon in two weeks, and I applied, with Charles. And then, yeah, met you guys.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And and to be clear, you to let everyone know that we were blown away by you and your brother's Charles' project, and we gave you, I think, your first job, both of you in web three. Right? We gave you the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Exactly. Yeah. I think I

SPEAKER_01: I think the, like, the Monday after I don't know. Like, I I feel like I immediately quit and started working with you guys full time on block apps. Yeah. Well, I we I think we tried to give you a job on the spot because you guys were Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

SPEAKER_02: I remember there was, like, a couple week consulting

SPEAKER_03: transition period while

SPEAKER_01: you know? Yeah. I think that's true. Yeah. Maybe it was, like, we started, like, hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then full time. So yeah.

SPEAKER_02: So So with Counterparty, you you could have been on. Yeah. Exactly.

SPEAKER_01: If only.

SPEAKER_00: So what inspired SuperRare? Like, you know, I know you when you're working with us, you kind of became our head of product, and you were working on a bunch of those enterprise implementations. But, you know, what triggered you to kind of create super rare, which is what for anyone who doesn't know one of the first NFT platforms really out there.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I well, I mean, it was super interesting. Right? You know, like, we were all kind of on the Ground Floor at the Consensus office or, like, know, at least me and Kieran were hanging out there. And, like, watching the ICO boom happen was fascinating because I was like, I met me and Kieran talked a bunch about, you know, ERC 20 tokens, and, like, I found it was, like, super interesting that it was this very small bit of stand like, you know, it's a it's a super simple protocol, very simple code. But, like, the adoption created this like, yeah, there's massive wealth generation. And even if there were also lots of scams, I'd say generally net positive for, you know, humans and the economy. Like, it was, like, incredible to see that happen. And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-seven 21, and, like, I saw the CryptoPunks launch. And I was like, oh, this is pretty crazy. If you think about the consumer web, it's all, you know, an image and a title tag and some metadata. So, like, it could be that, like, the entire consumer web turns into, like, NFTs and that, you know, like I don't know exactly what the business model is gonna look like, but the, you know, the the total addressable market is probably pretty large. So that got me into NFTs. And then on the flip side of that, I was also kinda in and around the New York art scene, like, know, going to the art fairs. I had friends who were, you know, looking for gallery representation and kinda part of the, you know, the business of art. And it just seemed obvious. I was like, oh, there's now a way to kinda, like, truly own digital assets, and this is obviously gonna apply to digital art. So it's kinda like the marriage of, you know, like, my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.

SPEAKER_00: And, like, what was it like to be at the forefront of, like, the NFT explosion? Because you guys like, I I know for a long time you were building, and it was like, oh, you know, like, how's it going? And, you know, the like, no one is really paying attention. And all of a sudden, you know, next day, everyone's talking about NFTs.

SPEAKER_01: It it was absolutely crazy. It was hard to be like it's just, like, completely surreal the whole time. Like, it felt like a dream. Like, we, you know, we started in 2018. We we were we tried to raise money. It never really worked. Like, by the time we raised, we were already, you know, cash flow positive and, like, making more than we were paying ourselves. So That's best situation to possibly be. Yeah. It was, like, it was much easier to raise then than when I was like, I have this really cool idea. So it was, yeah, it was like, you know, it was a it was a grind. It was super volatile many times. I was just like, what am I doing with my life? But, yeah, then it just it just really started, like I remember the numbers were, like, doubling every month for a while. Like, remember it was October 2020. It was our first million dollar month in volume, and I was just like, this is wild. You know? Because but, you know, twelve months ago, we were like, alright. So the volume was, like, $5,000, and we made a couple $100. Okay.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And were were you guys the first self minting NFT platform? I think, like, we're we were trying to talk about that, actually. Yeah. We

SPEAKER_01: yeah. We were the first to come like, I think there were maybe a couple other minting tools, but, like, we were the first to combine, like, the minting and the marketplace experience. So was like, there weren't, like, great minting tools then. So we're like, we started with the minting tool, and then we're like, alright. I guess people need a place to sell this, so we'll, like, we'll build the marketplace too. And, you know, it's partially just out of necessity because, like, the the tooling sucked at the time.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I I it's it's funny because I remember, if you recall, the what labor became the flow guys doing CryptoKitties. They were based in Vancouver, and I was, like Mhmm. Talking to them about, you know, running it on our blockchain and doing that kind of stuff too at the time. But and, I mean, you've done so much. One of the amazing things that it's the launch of the rare token, and you guys seem to be one of the first projects that was really committed to sort of figuring out DAO governance in reality? Like, how how you know, what what led to that, and how did that go? Like, how you know, what did you figure out there?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I mean, you know, early on, I was, like, part of, like, what got me excited about Bitcoin and Ethereum is just the idea of these networks where, you know, the users of the networks also participate in upside of the network. You know, like, there there's the, you know, like, the the fat protocol article that was, you know, super popular, like, 2016. So just, like, thinking about, like, okay. What does monetization look like? And, you know, can you build platforms that are, you know, like they're more, like, collaborative than extractive, where it's like, you know, if you're meta, you're just like, I'm just gonna extract as much metadata and, you know, sell ads, you know, which is a great business. But, partially, for me, it was almost like a, you know, a thought experiment of, like, is it possible to build a network where you don't have to sell ads and it could be, like maybe it's a marketplace as the business model, and then, you know, kinda it's, like, collective ownership via the token. So, yeah, I was, you know, drink drinking a lot of the crypto Kool Aid at the time. Did you trust that? I still am. Yeah. I guess to be Yeah. Yeah. But Did you do it, like, classic

SPEAKER_03: ICO style? Was there, like, fixed price auction? How how did it how did the rare get in there?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. We actually just did a huge airdrop. Probably one of our mistakes Yeah. Is, like, So, like, we should've probably, you know, sold a bunch of tokens, but we actually just gave them away. And yeah. I mean, yeah, there's plenty of challenges to, like you know, DAOs are hard to manage and run. But, yeah, it's cool to see the current administration kinda, like, change tack and actually seem like they're interested in, like, building and pushing forward. So

SPEAKER_00: What do you think the biggest challenge was in what do you think, you know, the biggest challenge was in running a DAO? Because I think all of us had that sort of as an ideal state with the crypto kool aid, you know, running things completely decentral. What do you think are, you know, the challenges you faced when you did it and that are still out there, do you think?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I mean, I think still one of the bigger challenges is regulatory. Regulatory. Like, you have you know, like, you're kinda, like, trying to read the tea leaves, and then rather than just making, like, the bet you're like, okay. Well, this is the simplest, best decision. You're like, okay. Well, this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this. And, like, how do we, you know, not get in trouble for trying to experiment? And it's obviously you know, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear, like, rules. You know, it's like the Do you think like, the the Gensler era of, you know, enforcement.

SPEAKER_00: The dark the dark ages. You know? Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: I remember there was, like, a couple week consulting

SPEAKER_03: transition period while

SPEAKER_01: you know? Yeah. I think that's true. Yeah. Maybe it was, like, we started, like, hourly, like, you know, getting to know each other a little bit and then full time. So yeah.

SPEAKER_02: So So with Counterparty, you you could have been on. Yeah. Exactly.

Like, it was, like, incredible to see that happen. And so then I saw some of the standards conversations around ERC-seven 21, and, like, I saw the CryptoPunks launch.

I was like, oh, there's now a way to kinda, like, truly own digital assets, and this is obviously gonna apply to digital art. So it's kinda like the marriage of, you know, like, my interest in the tech side, but then also my interest and passions around art.

SPEAKER_00: And, like, what was it like to be at the forefront of, like, the NFT explosion?

You're like, okay. Well, this is not clear what this means, so maybe we should do this. And, like, how do we, you know, not get in trouble for trying to experiment? And it's obviously you know, the position is friendlier, but there's still no clear, like, rules. You know, it's like the Do you think like, the the Gensler era of, you know, enforcement.

SPEAKER_00: The dark the dark ages. You know? Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Gary's gonna be turning up for a job somewhere soon, isn't he? You know? Yeah.

SPEAKER_03: Man. Do you think of it more like the advice? Do you think of it more like it should be, like, a representative democracy? Like, should be be be, like, passing bills in there? I I think they're, like, the proposals and there's, like, delegation usually is the model for it. Yeah. Could also be, like, just, like, you got a couple leaders, but the stake could call, you know, confidence vote or something or, like, people like too. I haven't tried it yet, but, looks like, like, MetaDAO is trying to do that sort of thing.

SPEAKER_01: I think and and I think it kinda depends on, like, specifically what you're doing. You know, if it's something like, you know I mean, Bitcoin and Ethereum are obviously not DAOs, but just, you know, where it's, like, if small changes are can have potentially, like, catastrophic impact, I think that's one thing. If you know it's you know, like, super where it's, like, if there's a there's a low level protocol and there's application and, like, you know, other than, like, the escrow contracts for auctions and things, like, the stakes are, like, fairly low. I do kinda like the idea of, like, you'd sorta like if you can empower, like, a team or a few individuals to kinda just keep going, and then the token holders can say, like, tell people to stop versus, like, having to approve everything. Like, that's a very silly arduous process. And I feel like it should be more like, okay. If you're it's, like, veering off in the wrong direction, you can like, there's a way to kinda, like, raise your voice and have influence it. But, like, you know, having a vote on, like, what color the button should be or something is very absurd.

SPEAKER_00: I I'm curious, like, you know, given that you're a decentralization advocate, how do you balance, like, being a curated kind of platform and being open? You know? Like, how do you think about those two? Because I think one of the advantages of Super Rare with the curation side and art, you keep the quality very, very high. And Yeah. Unlike, you know, more marketplace type NFT platforms, which just frankly puts a ton of crap, like, out there. So Yeah. Yeah. How how do you balance those two? I I think I keep decentralized, do you think?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. No. It yeah. I mean, it's kinda challenging, and it's almost, almost a paradox. But I think, you know, we've kind of always taken the, like, minimal decentralization. So it's like, you have it where it's useful, and then, you know, like, one example is, like, we were, like, talking about, like, token models
