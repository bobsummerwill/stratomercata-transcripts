**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** What are you using? I use Restream. We try to use something and it streams on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time.

**[00:06] SPEAKER_01:** So we're using Streamyard too. We're using Streamyard and I'm just double checking.

**[00:09] SPEAKER_02:** We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit...

**[00:12] SPEAKER_03:** None of them are perfect.

**[00:13] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. I'll share the one. I don't know if you should try this one, but this one looks pretty cool, pretty great.

**[00:18] SPEAKER_02:** Because you're thinking there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Like, isn't there just an answer that just works?

**[00:23] SPEAKER_00:** But the thing is, those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind.

**[00:26] SPEAKER_03:** They don't like it.

**[00:27] SPEAKER_02:** They want to trap you in.

**[00:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, exactly. That's against our vision, you know.

**[00:30] SPEAKER_02:** X doesn't even have a means to download the bloody audio.

**[00:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it's...

**[00:33] SPEAKER_02:** Why would you want to download it?

**[00:34] SPEAKER_00:** You know, that's something... I guess the next step in maybe...

**[00:36] SPEAKER_02:** Like, you want to use it somewhere else.

**[00:37] SPEAKER_00:** Or you see somebody else be able to own your data. You know, on all those platforms, even owning a query or just access. Something I love about Google is I can go, I can activate the tracking, but at least I can go and say, what did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store, it was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the time they have thousands of data points, but they don't even share it with you.

**[00:58] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly.

**[00:59] SPEAKER_00:** I find it quite wild.

**[01:00] SPEAKER_03:** 5:01.

**[01:01] SPEAKER_01:** We are live. So we're live. No, no, I'm ready. No, but that was a good cold intro. Right, so we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us, for a change, are live in real life, in the same room. In the same room.

**[01:13] SPEAKER_02:** Amazing.

**[01:14] SPEAKER_01:** And you are a special guest.

**[01:15] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah, sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Reda Berrehili. Yes, Reda, who is the Executive Director of the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years.

**[01:27] SPEAKER_03:** Healthy run.

**[01:28] SPEAKER_01:** Exactly.

**[01:29] SPEAKER_02:** Right.

**[01:30] SPEAKER_03:** So, yeah, like it's eight years now.

**[01:31] SPEAKER_00:** It was 2017. Yeah.

**[01:32] SPEAKER_02:** February 2017 was the launch date, on the 28th.

**[01:34] SPEAKER_03:** There was pre-work solidly before, at least three months, maybe more.

**[01:36] SPEAKER_02:** There were meetings I was part of in December and January. I mean, those were the first big meetings.

**[01:39] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[01:40] SPEAKER_02:** You know, with whatever, 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, like it really started probably at Devcon 2. Really close with the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

**[01:47] SPEAKER_03:** There was the kickoff meeting at the J.P. Morgan office, which was pretty big. And even before, there were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft.

**[01:51] SPEAKER_02:** Right. So that public launch was February.

**[01:53] SPEAKER_03:** It was February.

**[01:54] SPEAKER_00:** But...

**[01:55] SPEAKER_02:** But December, there was an internal one. And then JP Morgan was in January 2017. But yeah, a lot of those initial contacts happened at Devcon 2 in October the previous year.

**[02:01] SPEAKER_01:** Well, in the Devcon 2...

**[02:02] SPEAKER_03:** Oh yes.

**[02:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So basically, there were a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And yeah, the group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at a Starbucks just off-site. And that was sort of the idea formation thing.

**[02:15] SPEAKER_02:** And then Matt Spoke of Nuco held a little bar-side event as well. Which... Do we have some technical issues?

**[02:19] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, okay, hold on a second.

**[02:20] SPEAKER_03:** I'm just gonna push...

**[02:21] SPEAKER_00:** James is gonna tell everybody we have a technical issue.

**[02:22] SPEAKER_02:** Everybody.

**[02:23] SPEAKER_01:** I will fix that. Oh, did I... I messed up the Twitter.

**[02:25] SPEAKER_02:** You did a bad one.

**[02:26] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I did a bad one. So everyone, please join us on YouTube.

**[02:28] SPEAKER_03:** Spaces at 5 a.m., right?

**[02:29] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[02:30] SPEAKER_02:** But yeah, Matt Spoke held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to and there were various others there. I don't know if you went to that one as well.

**[02:35] SPEAKER_01:** I didn't go to that one. So I think the main thing was that... Yeah, so I think the main thing—I'm gonna try and fix this right now on Twitter. Live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now. If not, I did choose a...

**[02:43] SPEAKER_02:** But also parallel in that, because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was like an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise.

**[02:52] SPEAKER_01:** That's right.

**[02:53] SPEAKER_02:** So at some point he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was not quite the same group. It was a larger group but slightly different.

**[02:59] SPEAKER_01:** Nuco was part of that.

**[03:00] SPEAKER_02:** Nuco was part of that also, by the way, we should introduce ourselves.

**[03:03] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Hi, I'm Bob Summerwill. I'm Head of Ecosystem at Strato Mercato.

**[03:06] SPEAKER_03:** James Lubin, CEO of Black Ops, creator of Strato Mercato.

**[03:09] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[03:10] SPEAKER_01:** And Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer, Black Ops. So sorry, back...

**[03:13] SPEAKER_00:** But...

**[03:14] SPEAKER_02:** But yeah, Amos as well.

**[03:15] SPEAKER_01:** Do you remember them?

**[03:16] SPEAKER_03:** Yeah, we should check in on... I haven't thought about Amos in like several years until this moment.

**[03:19] SPEAKER_02:** So the interesting thing about what they were doing—that was like some Taiwan bank consortium thing.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yep.

**[03:23] SPEAKER_02:** But then they did work on Chinese cryptography and stuff. They've got differing requirements, right?

**[03:26] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[03:27] SPEAKER_02:** And Masterchain, which was in Russia, that was like a Sberbank thing.

**[03:29] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[03:30] SPEAKER_00:** Before they got sanctioned. I have a question because I was not at EEA at that time, and so it's very interesting for me to know—what were the hopes and excitement that you saw? You were part of those early conversations. This was created by 13 companies. It was a pretty big event, you know.

**[03:42] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah.

**[03:43] SPEAKER_00:** As you mentioned, J.P. Morgan and everything. All those big names coming into the ecosystem. What were the hopes and the overall atmosphere when the EEA was created eight years ago?
