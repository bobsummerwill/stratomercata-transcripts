**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** What are you using? I use Restream. We tried to use something, and it streamed on Twitter, I think YouTube, and LinkedIn at the same time. So we're using StreamYard.

**[00:09] SPEAKER_02:** We're using StreamYard, and I'm just double-checking. Screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that works. Everything seems a bit...

**[00:15] SPEAKER_04:** No. I'm perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Then I'll share the one. I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one looks pretty cool, pretty good. Because you're thinking that there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need.

**[00:26] SPEAKER_02:** Like, is there just an answer that just works?

**[00:28] SPEAKER_04:** But the thing is, like, those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind. They don't like it. They wanna track you in. Yeah, exactly. And so that's against our vision. You know? On X, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah. Why would you wanna download it? You know, like, that's something, I guess, the next step in the maybe, like, five, ten years. Somebody else? Be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms. Even own a query or just access. You know? Something I love about Google is, like, I can go, I can activate, you know, like, the tracking, you know, but at least I can go and say, what did you do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of those things, they have, like, thousands of data points, but they don't even share it with you. Yeah. Exactly. That's right. And I find it quite...

**[01:22] SPEAKER_03:** Quite well.

**[01:23] SPEAKER_01:** Five zero one. Oh, yeah. We are live. So we are live. No. No. No. I'm ready. No. But that was a good cold intro, right? So we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us, for a change, are live in real life. In the same room. In the same room. Amazing. And you are a special guest.

**[01:42] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us, Meslam. Yes. Exactly. Meslam, who is the Executive Director of the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand in or been a part of over the years. Yeah. Healthy run. Yes. Exactly.

**[01:59] SPEAKER_03:** Right. So yeah. Is it, like, it's eight years now? Since 2017. Yep. February 2017 was the launch date on the 28th. There was prework...

**[02:08] SPEAKER_02:** Solidly before. At least three months, they did work. There were meetings I was part of in December and January. I mean, those were the first big meetings. Right. You know, with whatever, thirty, forty people, crazy amounts. But yeah, like, it really started probably at Devcon 2, really. It did. It did. Those were the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

**[02:27] SPEAKER_03:** But there was the kickoff meeting at the JPMorgan office, which was pretty big. And even before, there were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft.

**[02:34] SPEAKER_02:** Right. So that was public launch in February. But December, there was an internal one, and then JPMorgan was in January 2017. But yeah, like, a lot of those initial contacts happened at Devcon 2. Yep. In October the previous year. Well, in Devcon 2. Oh, yes. Yeah. So, like, basically...

**[02:52] SPEAKER_01:** Basically, there was a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And yeah, like, the group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at, like, a Starbucks just off-site. And, you know, that was sort of the idea formation thing about the...

**[03:10] SPEAKER_02:** And then Matt Spoke of Nuco held a little bar-side event as well, which we had some technical issues. Space. Yeah. 5 AM.

**[03:17] SPEAKER_04:** That's not—oh, okay. Hold on one second. Just gonna push. James is gonna tell everybody.

**[03:22] SPEAKER_02:** We have a technical issue, everybody.

**[03:24] SPEAKER_01:** I can—I will fix that. Oh, did I? I messed up the Twitter. You did a bad one. Yeah. I did a bad one. So everyone please join us on YouTube. Spaces at 5 AM.

**[03:34] SPEAKER_02:** Right. Yes. Half by 12 AM. Matt Spoke held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to. There were various others there. If you went to that as well...

**[03:43] SPEAKER_01:** I didn't go to that one. So I think the main thing was that—yeah. So I think the main thing—I'm gonna try and fix this right now on Twitter. Live technical support. See if I can resolve it right now. If not...

**[03:54] SPEAKER_04:** I am.

**[03:55] SPEAKER_02:** I did choose a—there also has parallel in that, because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was, like, an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise. That's right. So at some point, he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was not quite the same group. It was a larger group, but slightly different. Luca was part of that. Luca was part of that. Yeah. Also, by the way, we should introduce ourselves.

**[04:25] SPEAKER_03:** Oh, we should. Like that. Yeah. Hi. I'm Boston Wilson. I'm Head of Ecosystem at...

**[04:30] SPEAKER_03:** Chain. James, CEO of BlockOps. Victor Wong. Creators of...

**[04:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I'm Victor Wong, Chief Product Officer of BlockOps. So sorry. Back. But yeah, AMMask as well. Do you remember them?

**[04:41] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Oh, yeah. So Taiwan. We should check in on—I haven't thought about AMMask until...

**[04:46] SPEAKER_02:** No. In, like, several years until the beginning. So the interesting thing about what they were doing, so that was, like, some Taiwan bank consortium thing. Yep. But then they did work on, like, Chinese cryptography and stuff. Like, they've got different requirements. Right? Yeah. And the Masterchain, which was in Russia, that was like a Sberbank thing. Yeah.

**[05:03] SPEAKER_04:** Sberbank was paid for the class sanctioned. I have a question. I could even—I could do it in Russian. Because you have a—you know, I was not at that time. And so it's very interesting for me to—you know, what were the hopes and really excitement that you see? You were part of those early conversations. This was created—yeah, 13, I think, companies. It's like a pretty—it was a pretty big event, you know. Yeah. As you mentioned, you know, like, JPMorgan and everything, all those big names coming into the ecosystem. And what were the hopes and really, like, the overall atmosphere, you know, when the EEA was created, like, eight years ago?

**[05:37] SPEAKER_02:** Yeah. Well, I mean, ConsenSys were very critical as well because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise engagement stuff. Right? You've got many, many companies starting to get interested in, hey, we wanna do a pilot. We wanna get involved. So ConsenSys were doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections of bringing those in together. But yeah, over those months, you really had—they got a hell of a lot of momentum.
