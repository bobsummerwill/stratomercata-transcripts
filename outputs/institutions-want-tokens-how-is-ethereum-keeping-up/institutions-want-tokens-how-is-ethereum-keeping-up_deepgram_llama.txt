SPEAKER_00: What are you using? I use Restream. We tried to use something, and it stream on Twitter, I think YouTube, and and LinkedIn at the same time. So we're using StreamYard

SPEAKER_02: to we're using StreamYard, and I'm just double checking. Screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that's Everything seems a bit

SPEAKER_04: No. I'm perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Then I'll I'll share the one. I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one looks pretty pretty cool, pretty good. Because you're thinking that there must be good software for this. Right? It's such a common need.

SPEAKER_02: Like, is there just an answer that just works?

SPEAKER_04: But the thing is, like, those platform, they're not built with interoperability in mind. Do you They they don't like it. They wanna track you in? Yeah. Exactly. And so that's that's that's that's against our vision. You know? On x, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah. It's Why would you wanna download it? You know, like, that's something you know, I guess the the next step in the maybe, like You wanna use it somewhere else? Five ten years. Somebody else? Be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms. Even own a query or just access. You know? Something I love about Google is, like, I can go I can activate, you know, like, the the tracking, you know, but at least I can go and say, what did what did you do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of those things, they have, like, thousands of datas, but, like, they don't even share it with you. Yeah. Exactly. That's right. And I find it quite

SPEAKER_03: quite well.

SPEAKER_01: Five zero one. Oh, yeah. We are live. So we are live. No. No. No. I'm ready. No. But that was a good cold intro. Right? So we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for the for change our life in real life In the same room. In the same room. Amazing. And you are a special guest,

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us, Meslam Yes. Exactly. Meslam, who is the executive director of the the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a had a hand in a part in over the years. Yeah. Healthy run. Yes. Exactly.

SPEAKER_03: Right. So yeah. Is it, like, it's eight years now? Since 2017. Yep. February 2017 was the last date on the twenty eighth. There was prework

SPEAKER_02: solidly before. At least three months, they didn't work. There were meetings I was part of in December and January. There would I mean, that that those were the first big meetings Right. You know, with whatever thirty, forty people, crazy amounts. But, yeah, like, it really started probably at DEFCON two, really. It did. It did. Those were the discussions. So that was Shanghai, October.

SPEAKER_03: But there was the kickoff meeting at the JPMorgan office, which was pretty big. And even for they were the closed door meetings at Microsoft.

SPEAKER_02: Right. So that that was public launch this February. It was February. But but December, there was a there was an internal, like, one, and then JPMorgan was in January 2017. But but, yeah, like, a lot of those initial contacts have happened at DevCon two Yep. In October the previous year. Well, in in the DevCon two Oh, yes. Yeah. So, like, basically

SPEAKER_01: basically, there was a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And, yeah, like, the the group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at, like, a Starbucks just off-site. And, you know, that was sort of the idea formation thing about the

SPEAKER_02: And then Matt spoke of new co held a little little bar side event as well, which we have some technical issues. Space. Yeah. 5AM.

SPEAKER_04: That's not Oh, okay. Hold on one second. Just gonna push. James is gonna tell everybody.

SPEAKER_02: We have a technical issue, everybody.

SPEAKER_01: I can I was I will fix that? Oh, did I? I messed up the Twitter. You did a bad one. Yeah. I did a bad one. So everyone please join us on YouTube. Spaces at 5AM.

SPEAKER_02: Right. Yes. Half by 12AM. Matt spoke held held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to when there were various others there, if you went to that as well.

SPEAKER_01: I I didn't go to that one. So I think it's I think the main thing was that yeah. So I think the main thing I'm I'm gonna try and fix this right now on Twitter. Live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now. If not

SPEAKER_04: I I am.

SPEAKER_02: I I I did choose a There also has parallel in that, because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time, was that there was like a an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise. That's right. So at some point, he just dumped the ball in a stack in a Slack and run away. That was the that was the technique. So that was not quite the same group. It was a larger group, but slightly different. Luca was part of that. Luca was part of that. Yeah. Also By the way, we should introduce ourselves. Oh, we we should. Like that. Yeah. Hi. I'm Boston Wilson. I'm head of ecosystem at

SPEAKER_03: Chain James, CEO of block ops. Victor Wong. Creators of.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I have Victor Wong, chief product officer of block ops. So sorry. Back. But but, yeah, AMMask as well. Do you remember them? Yeah. Oh, yeah. So Taiwan. We should check-in on. I I I haven't thought about AMMAS until

SPEAKER_02: No. In, like, several years until the beginning. So the interesting thing about what they were doing, so that was, like, some Taiwan bank consortium thing. Yep. But then they they did, like, work on, like, Chinese cryptography and stuff like they've got different requirements. Right? Yeah. And the master chain, which was in Russia, that was like a spare bank thing. Yeah.

SPEAKER_04: Spare bank was paid for the class sanctioned. I have a question. I could even I could do it Russian. Because you you have a you know, I was not at the at that time. And so it's very interesting for me to you know, what were the hopes and really excitement that you see. You you were part of those early conversation. This was created Yeah. 13, I think, companies. It's like a pretty it was a pretty big event, you know. Yeah. As you mentioned, you know, like, JPMorgan and everything, all those big names coming into the ecosystem. And and what were the hopes and and really, like, the overall, like, atmosphere, you know, when the EA was created, like, eight years ago? Yeah. Well, I mean so I I mean, consensus were very critical as well

SPEAKER_02: because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise, engagement stuff. Right? They it was you've got many, many companies, like, starting to get interested in, hey, you know, we wanna do a pilot. We wanna get involved. So consensus, we're doing a lot of those. So they ended up having a lot of those connections of bringing those those in together. But but, yeah, you you know, over those months, you you really have, like they've got a hell of a lot of momentum.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Really, really quick. So the the observation during dev con two when the idea was hatched was basically that at least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of of Ethereum. They had, like, hacked their own consensus algorithms and security and and Many guests. Many guests, indeed. We learned later that, like, like, a lot of JPMorgan's forum was initially built by Jeff Wilkie.

SPEAKER_02: He had, like, some kind of And that was not announced at the time of dev con two. That was still behind the scenes for a few months. Yeah. That happened just before the EA started. But but, yeah, you'd you'd you'd got all of this stuff brewing up, I mean, for years earlier. Like, if you think of, like, ERS DB that became Monax, that became Hyperledger Burrow, so that was a permissioned Ethereum client of POC five pre mainnet Mhmm. Yeah. Mid twenty fourteen of sticking in tandem in onto an EVM. So, yeah, like, you know, it was it was all a bit smashed apart,

SPEAKER_03: but it was like, the time is right for us to work together because we've all got the same needs. Us too. We had our own client, and they got used in a bunch of the consensus consulting engagements at that time, and we started, even then, kinda tuning it for enterprise. And so I guess the idea was like, well, maybe enterprises won't adopt if there isn't a standard Yeah. For all of this new stuff that they need that's above and beyond the base

SPEAKER_01: Well, I I think clients. I I think it was even beyond that. Like, was just tons of technical work going on in each individual company siloed to get a, like, a Ethereum to do what they wanted to do in a private way. Yeah. So everyone was, like, bolting on these things. And what came out of that those early conversations at at DevCon was, wait. Like, while doing similar things, maybe if we all kind of work together, we could do it faster and get this up faster. And that was all around private ethereum. And I guess also, like, a marriage between,

SPEAKER_02: like, kind of customers of these things and builders Yeah. Of of saying you've got all these kind of start up y kind of companies that are making Ethereum things, and you've obviously got big demand from really major enterprises to have this, but it's there's but, yeah, on that standardization side, there was, like, nothing, and it's, like, you're all gonna get vendor locked, like, instantly, and it'll all just be arbitrarily different and painful and horrible. So let's try and work out because well, at some point as well with with Quorum, it was kind of like, you know, are we gonna, like, collaboratively do code bases as well? Like, you know, Hyperledger another pause. Was another piece into this is that is that a few months earlier, I've I've spent a bunch of time working on c plus plus relicensing, c plus plus client to get back to Apache two, so it could have been contributed into Hyperledger and we could have, like, gathered around that. That fucked up. So the EA was kind of a backup, I guess. It's like, Ryan, we can't have this grand fusion, but there's enough happening on the Ethereum side that we can at least get all the Ethereum, you know, pieces together and and and then, yeah, I guess it it went quite quickly from, okay. We're not we don't wanna straight compete with with Hyperledger. Having a shared code base also kind of, like, screws up companies.

SPEAKER_03: Commented. So I think let let me you know, in the spirit of spiciness,

SPEAKER_01: I think the enterprise users would have preferred a shared code base. Right. And they wanted to commoditize any difference among the startups out of existence so that they could never be vendor locked again. They've Yeah. Had these

SPEAKER_03: horrific, you know, IBM nightmares, Oracle nightmares over the years, and they're just like, not not this time.

SPEAKER_02: We're not going to live through this. I mean, also, you know, you have got that market pressure, right, of of quarter coming out Mhmm. Of IBM launching fabric. They were already gonna end up that kind of, you know, nominally open source but quite proprietary. So those were both shooting for release in February 2017. So it's that kind of timeline is like, right, we've gotta get our shit together to be able to do like an Ethereum product thing that can have some hope against IBM, you three.

SPEAKER_03: I suppose, know DA at that time, I remember one of our prominent enterprise user EEA members said, you know, yeah, they've got a call with, you know, 300 people on it every week trying to sell into the big banks, let's say. Right. And, it's funny that all of the like, Ethereum just survived all of this more or less not paying any attention than, like,

SPEAKER_01: you know, the this this competition kinda came in Well, I think there was another parallel thing that was happening. At that DevCon, really, we're, like, the first like, the kind of enterprise use cases we talk about today. Like, for example, Santander talked about, you know, US dollar on chain, which we all recognize as a stablecoin now. And It didn't make to design that button or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tokenized

SPEAKER_04: bank deposit effects. You see, Victor, I think that's a very cool parallel. Like, you set the stage pretty well for, like, you know, where it's coming from. Yeah. And then where it started eight years ago, you mentioned, you know, innovation labs, like, starting to contribute to some codes. We've known, like, the use cases that blockchain and Ethereum can solve for a long time. Right. Oh, yeah. But it's only actually now, and it's been for probably, like, for the last year, that things have been have been really changing drastically. Yeah. And to to take, you know, like, your your words for, like, when you say innovation lab, it's it's not innovation lab anymore looking at at, you know, how they implement blockchain in their Yeah. Ecosystem. It's really like It's actually Executive executive team that say, hey. We wanna plan what is the production, like, how we get it to market. Thankfully, like, they're scared now. So, like, they they better move for us. I I don't know if it's, like, there there is no. There is but there were some interesting some interesting talk, you know, like, when we were at CyBoost, like, SWIFT conference, like, last time. Mentioned that because, like,

SPEAKER_01: you were just at Cybos, and you're dealing with, like, what we think of as tried by institutional players. And that's, you know, where you have a lot of communication. So, like, what were your impressions about where they're at with that? Because that's the other side that we talk about last year. The digital asset tokenization

SPEAKER_04: is definitely a hot topic everyone is looking. Because they know it's happening. They wanna be involved, and it's more and now, especially, like, there is less there is less, like, regulatory, you know I'm sure they inject the the listeners may not know what Cybos is. Oh, yeah. So Cybos is the is the big SWIFT conference. SWIFT, if you're not familiar, is a it's a messaging system that a lot of 11,000 financial institution around the world it's actually a co op. It's a DAO for a trade buy.

SPEAKER_03: Kudos to Danielle from ConsenSys who said that to me once. It is a DAO. Although, it's like, can can we buy in now? I feel like a very easy I guess you're best. Restricted. Yeah. That's, you know, like, token gate. Yeah. And the token is having probably a bank license. The the London Metal Exchange is like this too. It's like you you wanna sign up. You gotta, like, buy a bunch of shares and, like Yeah. See. You know, then there's an annual fee and whatnot, and you have to, like, put someone

SPEAKER_04: there all the time. To join the trade guild. Yes. Yes. I that you gotta do your Yes. Yeah. Exactly. And so set big conference is the it's a big makeup of payments, I I would say, every year. So you have all the big financial institution. Also, like, you know, global financial institution, like, you know, like clearing house settlements. So, you work there, DTCC, etcetera, but also, like, all the banks. And they gather here, and then there is a a lot of conversation. What is very interesting is actually Cybos and Swift is a very, like, kind of standard organization. Because what they do is, like, how we make sure, like, we send messaging across all of us that everyone is sure is gonna understand. And so they used to to have a different, like, kind of messaging format, and recently now, they're migrating to something new, which is high ISO 222 Okay. Which is if you wanna go and dive deeper into this, this is really, like, the how every financial institution want to discuss. They've been working on that spec for a long time, And that's how anything that can touch finance

SPEAKER_03: from securities to payment, like, they're they have to be qualified. Yeah. I think it's good to explain. So, like, most of finance gets cleared through messaging. Mhmm. And it's like so crypto people are used to, like, putting a transaction in and then it goes everywhere. Yes. It's not really like this. Oh, yes. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Indeed. It is that

SPEAKER_04: the process of a you know, what we call delivery versus payment in in traditional finance, it's a it's a pretty complex thing because how you make sure, like, when you deliver the money, the money has been received, that you receive the asset, that everything has been you know? And it's a kind of a lot of dance because you receive message, you you send another one, and it's not like how we used to do where in crypto, we submit, and it's actually a atomic transaction, which is, like, just one thing. And when the transaction is complete, you know it's been executed, it's been delivered, and all the parties that is actually, you know, like, I give you the can. Well, I know I know you've been giving me, like, the money exactly. You know? Like, where actually there is, like, a little bit dense. Well, I put the can here. Like, you see the can that has been moving here. Like, you send the money. And and so the the blockchain here offers such efficiencies because things that were, like, you know, like, the t plus one or t plus two for some of the some of those different exchange. Now you you do it, like, well, depending of what chain you're gonna deploy Yeah. Between a second to even, like, less than that. Yeah. And, also, Swift

SPEAKER_03: isn't a payments mechanism. Right? No. It's a it's a message another that's another comment. So let's don't let let me, I think, interject with this specific example. I think they're biggest in FX. Right? Yes. So let's say I've got some USD, and I want some euro. And we kinda, like, agree to a USD euro trade. And so we, like I guess we look up whatever the pair is trading at. And I think it's like, I send my side of the trade with some unique ID to Swift, and you do too. And then Swift, like, checks if it matches. It charges, like, $7 either way. If it does match, then it'll, like, tell us that it matched.

SPEAKER_04: Well, I don't think it's actually exactly this way. It's more a Swift offer type of envelope and a format of envelope and paper and ink that we know how to use and how we're supposed to fill up some forms. Then how we trade those forms between different market participants, it's not much, you know, like, the people like, they're gonna be some, you know, corresponding banking that's gonna be, like, locally taking you cash, and they're gonna everyone is gonna take their share. But it's It's not moving the asset. It's just it's like

SPEAKER_03: like I have the USD on my bank list. That's big thing. You you got the euro Yeah. On your bank list. Talking to each other in a in a secure

SPEAKER_04: and compliant way for because it's also, oh, you send that. You have to send, like, some specific messaging for, like, compliance that net. Then I I send another one saying, hey. I checked. There is all the information, and you, you know, you A bunch of, like, local jurisdiction

SPEAKER_02: specific

SPEAKER_04: Yeah. It's like a lot of different handshakes, you know, for, like, all the Yeah. I looked at way someone described it. It's like a funny TCP handshake. It's

SPEAKER_01: it's sort of like what they're doing is tracking the transfers, but no money is actually moving, and then they have a list of IOUs. So, like, when when I send a swift transaction to from, like, let's say I send a $100 to you and France. And I go to my bank. I put in a $100. The money doesn't go anywhere.

SPEAKER_04: It just Oh, yeah. So the It's like the bank I have to write bank off by the bank. The end of the day Yes. Right. Money. RTGS. They're gonna do, like, the transfer actually. Exactly. That's like a different messaging. Like, the the Yeah. If you research and I'm not a Swift expert, but I have to learn that in the last couple of months, you know, I've done, like, a little bit more, like, deep dive. And it's fascinating because there is such a huge dance, you know, between, you know, like, two transfer of money because you have, you know, the money in your bank account, but then you actually central bank money, then you have this, like, the deposit money. Yeah. So, like, those, like, what you call, like, m zero, m one, m two. And and so all of that is pretty pretty complex. And then we're just talking about payment here. You know, talking about, you know, securities or, like, those other, like, financial instrument that you can exchange also using blockchain in a very efficient way. But that's you know, using stablecoin, you can mix everything super simple. And also one misconception maybe I would love to to mention is, like, the you know what? We we talked about stablecoin and CBDCs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They actually exactly the same thing. It's just in a different context. A CBDC is a stablecoin for central bank. And It's just the issuer. It's just the issuer is not the same as you know, we never gonna really touch, like, CBDCs Yeah. Because this is, like, the the money the the money of banks, if you if you say. But almost, I think, from a technical level, it's very, like, almost like a copy paste of the same contract. It's the mechanism. It's it's not. But we create, like, a whole different language and terminology for that, but they're actually very similar. And funny fact, those CBDCs, they've been doing, you know, like, the I think the baby needed to grow. You know, like, you said, DEFCON two. So it was a two years old kid, Ethereum.

SPEAKER_01: And we were like, hey. Come in here. You can manage, like, the most

SPEAKER_04: critical infrastructure of the planet, which is our money and how we do trade, and you can do all of this. And and I think, like, the Ethereum Foundation, I have to give them credit. Like, they yes. For a long time, they were saying, hey, guys. You're not considering the enterprise, everything. But I think they did the right they did the right thing because they protected, you know, like that baby. So it could grow, and we'd become like, you know now we had an age of, you know, it's more mature. It's more than ten years. It's still, like, not even a teenager. Like, the analogy was, like, was human is gonna take some limits. But we're at a point now where we have a technology, and Ethereum is really a capacity to answer all the challenges that are that are, like, facing, you know, that we're blocking with institutions without, which is, you know, well, scalability, privacy, you know, like, composability, and interoperability. You know? Yeah. Like, the the four points that you had in the in the ARC paper for from from from Circle. And now we have this. You know? Like, just last week, you know, z guessing can announce, like, up to 15,000 TPS. Yeah. And there is a new thing that almost every week have going on. So we really like now, like, the technology, when it comes up, say, well, I need to make sure, like, this is private. I need to make sure, like, this is a this is gonna, you know, be, like, be executed in a in a in a in a seamless way. Also, like, the the decentralization, it's more about the the way they look at it is more like the vendor lock in, I would say, the best analogy, is that you you wanna make sure the infrastructure you rely on is gonna be able to absorb your activity, but also be resilient enough. Yeah. This we still have some work because it's it's definitely and I understand the perspective of institution to deploy on, like, public infrastructure.

SPEAKER_01: You know, at first, when we keep it, yeah, showed up, like, you know,

SPEAKER_04: twenty twenty, twenty five years ago, something like that, I think. I mean, I remember I was in my in my college of in like, my engineering college. I was at the board, and we were talking about having a wiki, you know, for doing some articles. And they were, like, those very academic guys that, this is this is unacceptable.

SPEAKER_01: It's not a you know, all that French accent. And this is unacceptable whenever you are gonna do this.

SPEAKER_04: This is anyone can put any information. This is not trust. To be clear, you are French. Yeah. You are like Yeah. Yeah. You are allowed to. Yeah. You are allowed to. French too. Yeah. And so and but they were in French. Like, they were very, you know and protecting this and at that time, I said, well, we cannot trust, you know, something that's been built collectively like this. But now we know you have to take a grain of salt, but it's actually much more accepted. You know? Like, that those are, like, reliable source of information and that you can have things that are being built publicly that are actually very resilient.

SPEAKER_01: I mean, some I'm so sorry. I was just gonna ask, like but, like, there's always this, like, gap between what traditional institutions understand about like, we all understand what's been capable for a really, really long time. But are there still gaps, or do you think that's been closed now? Like, it's maybe grown up fully? Or but, like, even if even, like, when the capability is there, there's still,

SPEAKER_04: like, a knowledge gap, I think, sometimes. You know what I Let me put it this way. There is about if you combine all the different type of money, a $123,000,000,000,000 of cash around the world. Right. Right. 300 billions are on chain. Right. So the numbers talk for itself. We're very early. So there is people like they they can I think we we still have, like, a lot of work to do in term of education? But by education, I mean, really talking from product perspective. What business problem I can solve for you? How it's gonna be done, what is gonna be the maintenance after, how, like, how you're gonna deal with a very specific use cases. And and so you can have, like, some teams that already, like, have an understanding, you know, like, what you can achieve. Yeah. But we still, like, need to provide, I think, as an ecosystem more structuring, you know, like, who you can work with, well, like, the different vendors, what services they can do, where they can help, what's the type of contract you're gonna have after. And and really giving, like, that overall perspective of, like, a new entrant, you know, in the in the market. And so some of them, they understand very well, and they have already, like, some pretty detailed question, you know, even, like, asking me alright. One, we need to increase, like, the contract size from the 24 to forty forty eight kilobytes, and we have some, you know, like, those those stack overflow issue, like, well known. So Yeah. The stack depth one that was always a problem. And so Yeah. There is some of them. It's this. But but then some other ones in in this this more product, they're gonna ask me, okay.

SPEAKER_01: What why should I go on an l two? What is the l one? What does it mean? And what about those chain? What are, like, the primitives, you know, explaining, like, well, if you build on any l twos,

SPEAKER_04: you actually gonna choose maybe one vendor in some way, but you can completely move your asset freely among all the ecosystem. The wallets are gonna be the same. A lot of things are gonna be equivalent that you don't have to rebuild. Mhmm. And and so those are saying, you know, like, you you need to explain. Some of them, maybe people, they're gonna say, well, what what what is what is this? This is just, like, some some scammy or something like that. Think you can find all the layers, but but now people, they also they see, like, the potential of, like, what you can do with with digital, digital assets, you know, tokenization. Right. And for, like, people were a little bit, like, looking around. I'm very excited to see what's gonna happen in the next six to twelve months because, you know, like, Genius Tech was signed July, you know, or something like this. Clarity act, I think, is still still a bit ongoing. But so now we, the like and and we we kinda also hear that, like, there's really a companies from either direction. So, okay, how how we're gonna implement this? The fintech is also moving, so they're they're they're like, the fact that they're building their l even if they're building their l one, I wish they would do some l twos, and the my door will always be open Right. When when you wanna consider that. There there is a pretty great tool that can help. But but that's gonna push the market and from a, like, financial institution to really, like, adopting this. There is organization like DTCC, you know, like, the biggest clearinghouse in the world. Like, all the securities in the world basically are being cleared about over there. They released, like, an incredible product, like, four months ago in April, like, the great collateral, where they have, like, a collection of, like, hundreds of spot contract that allows you to clear and to make some margin call and collateral management from different jurisdiction, which is a fantastic reuse case when you you see I'm not a I'm not a collateral management expert. Mhmm. But I I understand the value, like, how this unlock, you know, like, you you actually have some something that you can take from your your bank in Japan that you're gonna post for something in in US because you have a market event. And this is something you would not even imagine before. And now you can do it, and it's, like, compliant. It's actually, like, it's legal, and then that's gonna unlock so much efficiencies. And so that's in the next, like, twelve months. That's gonna be, like, huge game changer. So it sounds like,

SPEAKER_01: you know, the lid has been lifted off, and there's a ton of demand. But it's like walking down the path to supply that demand. That's the part that people are figuring out. Right? Like, is that right? Like, is that how Very I think the

SPEAKER_04: it's such a very transformative technology for how those business operate. There is also how I'm gonna make money. Okay.

SPEAKER_03: So there's a fear element to it. Right? Like, go ahead. At least I It's it's it's like, where well, now I can have, like, chat. Yeah. Like Yeah. I mean I'm a PSP provider.
