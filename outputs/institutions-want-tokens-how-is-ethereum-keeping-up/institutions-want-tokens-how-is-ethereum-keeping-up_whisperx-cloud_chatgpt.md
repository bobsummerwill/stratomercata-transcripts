**[00:01] SPEAKER_04:** I use Restream. We try to use something and it streams on Twitter, I think YouTube and LinkedIn at the same time. So we're using StreamYard too. We're using StreamYard and I'm just double checking. We have been screwing around with different tools trying to find anything that seems a bit... Not all perfect, yeah. Yeah. I'll share the one. I don't know if you've tried this one, but this one is pretty cool. Pretty great. Because you're thinking, there must be good software for this, right? It's such a common need. Isn't there just an answer that just works? But the thing is, those platforms, they're not built with interoperability in mind. They don't like it. They want to trap you in. Yeah, exactly. X especially. So that's against our vision. On X, there isn't even a means to download the bloody audio. Yeah, it's... Why would you want to download it? You know, like that's something, you know, I guess the next step in maybe like... You want to use it somewhere else? Are you seeing somebody else? Be able to own your data, you know, in all those platforms. Even own a query or just access, you know. Something I love about Google is like I can go, I can activate, you know, like the tracking, you know. But at least I can go in and say, what did I do that week? I went in front of that restaurant or that store. It was pretty nice. And I can go and see and check. I have access to that. It can be helpful. But most of the things, they have like thousands of data, but they don't even share it with you. Yeah, exactly. I find it quite, quite well.

**[01:32] SPEAKER_03:** 501. Oh, yeah. We are live. So we are live. No, no, no, I'm ready. No, but that was a good cold intro, right? So we have a very special guest today, but a special format because all of us for Jane Joe Live in real life. In the same room. In the same room. So we're amazing. And you are a special guest, do you want to intro? Yeah.

**[01:52] SPEAKER_01:** Sure. So, yeah, we have here today with us Redwan Meslen. Yes, exactly. Meslen, who is the executive director of the EEA, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which all of us at this table have had a hand and a part in over the years. The healthy run. Yes, exactly. So, yeah. It's eight years now. Since 2017, yeah. February 2017 was the launch date on the 28th. There was pre-work solidly before, at least three months, maybe more. There were meetings I was part of in December and January. I mean, those were the first big meetings, you know, with whatever, 30, 40 people, crazy amounts. But yeah, it really started probably at Devcon 2, really. It did? Yeah. So that was Shanghai, October. There was the kickoff meeting at the JPMorgan office, which was pretty big. They were the closed-door meetings at Microsoft. Right. So that public launch was February. It was February. But December, there was an internal one, and then JPMorgan...

**[02:55] SPEAKER_03:** was in January of 2017. But yeah, like a lot of those initial contacts have happened at Devcon 2 in October the previous year. Well, in the Devcon 2... Oh, yes. Yeah, so like basically, basically, there was a lot of conversations there about figuring out how to bring on enterprises too. And there were a lot of interested parties. And yeah, like, the group of people, which was I think about six people that were interested, met at like a Starbucks just off site. And, you know, that was sort of the idea formation thing about the... And then Matt spoke of NewCo held a little bar side event as well, which... Do we have some technical issues? I don't know. Oh, okay. Hold on a second. We have a technical issue, everybody. I will fix that. Oh, did I? I messed up the Twitter. You did a bad one. I did a bad one. So everyone, please join us on YouTube. Space is at 5 a.m. Right. Matt spoke, held a little event at one of the bars upstairs, which I went to, and there were various others there. I don't know if you went to that one as well. I didn't go to that one. So I think the main thing was that, yeah, so I think the main thing, I'm going to try and fix this right now on Twitter. Live technical support, see if I can resolve it right now. If not, I am.

**[04:06] SPEAKER_01:** I did choose a parallel in that because I was still working for the Ethereum Foundation at the time was that there was like an enterprise Slack set up there, which was actually started by Vitalik, who afterwards said people kept badgering him about enterprise stuff. So at some point he just dumped the ball in a Slack and ran away. That was the technique. So that was not quite the same group. It was a larger group that's slightly different. NewCo was part of that. NewCo was part of that. Also, by the way, we should introduce ourselves. Yeah, I'm Boxy Will, so I'm head of ecosystem at...

**[04:38] SPEAKER_02:** Stratum cut change. I was living CEO of BlockApps, Victor, creators of Strato. Yeah. And Victor Wong, chief product officer of BlockApps. So sorry, but yeah. Amos as well. Do you remember that? Oh yeah. We should check in on, I haven't thought about Amos in like several years until the moment. So the interesting thing about what they were doing, so that was like some Taiwan bank consortium thing. Yep.

**[04:59] SPEAKER_01:** But then they did work on Chinese cryptography and stuff. They've got differing requirements, right? And Masterchain, which was in Russia, that was like a Sberbank thing.

**[05:08] SPEAKER_04:** Because you have, you know, I was not at the EEA at that time, and so it's very interesting for me to, you know, what were the hopes and really excitement that you see, you know, you were part of those early conversations. This was real. Yeah, I think companies, it's like a pretty, it was a pretty big event, you know. Yeah, as you mentioned, you know, like JPMorgan and everything, all those big names coming into the ecosystem.

**[05:29] SPEAKER_01:** And what were the hopes and really like the overall atmosphere, you know, when the EEA was created like eight years ago? Yeah, well, I mean, so I mean ConsenSys were very critical as well, because, you know, they were doing a load of the enterprise engagement stuff, right? You've got many, many companies starting to get interested in, hey, we want to do a pilot, we want to get involved. So ConsenSys were doing a lot of those, so they ended up having a lot of those connections and bringing those in together. But yeah, you know, over those months, you really have like, they've got a hell of a lot of momentum. Yeah, really, really quick. So the observation during Devcon 2 when the idea was hatched was basically that...

**[06:06] SPEAKER_02:** At least at the innovation lab level, a lot of the enterprises were just using and forking their own flavor of Ethereum. They had like hacked their own consensus algorithms and security and many Geths, many Geths. Indeed. We learned later that like...

**[06:20] SPEAKER_01:** Like a lot of JPMorgan's Quorum was initially built by Jeff Wilcke. He had like some kind of... and that was not announced at the time of Devcon 2. That was still behind the scenes for a few months, but happened just before the EEA started. But yeah, you've got all of this stuff brewing up, I mean, for years earlier. Like, if you think of ErisDB that became Monax, that became Hyperledger Burrow. So that was a permissioned Ethereum client off POC5 pre-mainnet, mid-2014, of sticking in Tendermint onto an EVM. So yeah, like, you know, it was all a bit smished apart.

**[06:54] SPEAKER_02:** But it was like the time is right for us to work together because we've all got the same needs. Us too. We had our own client and they got used in a bunch of the consensus consulting engagements at that time. And we started even then kind of tuning it for enterprise. And so I guess the idea was like, well, maybe enterprises won't adopt if there isn't a standard for all of this new stuff that they need that's above and beyond the base standard.
