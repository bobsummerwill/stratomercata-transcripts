Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want me to act as an expert transcript editor specializing in Ethereum and blockchain technology. The task is to create a clean, readable transcript from the provided raw audio transcript.

First, I need to go through the raw transcript and identify the key elements that need correction. The user provided a list of known people and technical terms, so I should check for any misspellings or incorrect capitalizations there. For example, names like "Brian Smokovich" and terms like "Ethereum" need to be correctly spelled and capitalized.

Next, I need to ensure that all technical terms are properly formatted. Terms like "DeFi" should be in uppercase, and acronyms like "ERC-20" need the correct hyphenation. Also, any blockchain-specific jargon should be checked against the provided list to maintain consistency.

The user emphasized preserving all dialogue and content without summarization. So, I have to make sure that every part of the conversation is included, even if it's repetitive or filled with filler words. However, excessive fillers like "um" or "you know" can be removed to improve readability without altering the meaning.

Timestamps are crucial here. Each speaker's turn should start with a timestamp in the format [MM:SS], and each paragraph should correspond to a single speaker's contribution. I'll need to estimate the timestamps based on the flow of the conversation, ensuring that each new speaker's paragraph starts with the correct time.

Another important aspect is merging consecutive speech into paragraphs. If a speaker continues talking without interruption, their entire contribution should be in one paragraph. I'll have to read through the transcript to identify where one speaker stops and another begins, making sure the timestamps are correctly placed.

I also need to check the structure of the output. Each speaker's paragraph should be bolded with the timestamp, followed by their dialogue. There should be a blank line between each speaker's paragraph. I'll have to avoid any markdown formatting except for the bolded speaker labels and timestamps.

The user mentioned that the output should be approximately the same length as the input. I'll need to count the words in the input and ensure the output isn't significantly shorter. If it is, I might have removed too much content, so I'll have to review and add back any omitted parts.

Additionally, I should verify that all corrections are made according to the provided lists. For instance, "crypto x" should be "Crypto X" if that's the correct term. Also, any references to Ethereum-related terms should be capitalized correctly, like "Ethereum" instead of "ethereum".

Finally, I'll go through the entire transcript to ensure that the formatting is consistent, all technical terms are correctly used, and the dialogue flows naturally. This includes checking for proper punctuation and sentence structure to enhance readability without changing the original content.

SPEAKER_00: We are live. Are we live? We are live. Yes. So StreamYard says.

SPEAKER_01: My browser window doesn't say live.

SPEAKER_02: You guys have an intro you like to do?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Well, first Here we go. Here we go. Yeah. There we are.

SPEAKER_00: Go ahead, Bob.

SPEAKER_01: So hello, everybody. I guess I guess I guess we're ready to go. So so today, we have a special guest with us. It's the first time that that you and I have met Brian, but Mhmm. You are very familiar to all of my colleagues here as as an ex block appser.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Remember crypto x. You you are never an ex block appser. You're always, like, part of team block absurd. The alumni network. Yes. Exactly. Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. You guys gave me my first opportunity to work in Ethereum back in 2017, which it feels like ages ago. And, I mean, it is ages ago. Lifetime.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So thank you guys for that. Happy to be on here. It's always great seeing you guys around, and so talking about one of my favorite topics.

SPEAKER_01: Welcome. So, yeah, so welcome back. Would you like to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about what Pistachio is?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Sure. About that. So Brian Smokovich, bsmokes.eth on on Twitter. We're building PistachioFi. It's a it's a mobile first neobank, a a built entirely on crypto rails meant to provide premium savings with premium security. And the whole concept of better UX. Right? Like, I I I will get to the question in the moment of does is UX the key to mainstream adoption? But I wanted to really just build something that, you know, I think I think self custody is really important to me and I think really important to a lot of people about why we originally got into the space. But the UX for a lot of these apps was just always so terrible. Right? And so I just want I wanted to to be at the change that I wanted to see in the world and so decided to just say screw it and build my own, you know, basically, taught myself UI design in order to kinda to kinda begin this in the beginning and then built it literally by willing willing pistachio into existence and many, many, many, many, many iterations of of building the app. And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed that we've been, you know, publicly recognized by many Ethereum talking heads in in the sense of being recognized for our UX and what we've been designing and doing and building and, doing things in a way to just bring more more people on chain.

SPEAKER_01: I see that you you the the number you you said was 18 versions in five months.

SPEAKER_02: Oh, we've we've pushed out several beyond since that tweet. Probably at least three or four. So that yeah. We we we ship a lot. We ship and it's a a lot of just talking to users and finding what's broken, what's wrong. I'll stand I'll be at a conference and we'll literally stand over people's shoulders as they download the app and, like, watch. Every little tap, right, like, oh, the focus is wrong. Like, the focus is not beyond the keyboard in this certain one certain instance or the search is showing the wrong things. You know? And so every little but that's the kind of the thing about UX is you design something and then you build it. Right? And then it's it's it's of course, it's gonna be bugged. Everything is always bugged. Right? And, like, we go through rigorous testing to do it. But then when it goes on to somebody's, like, very specific use case because they touch certain things in a certain way and that's what triggered this one bug or it's on a certain app or a certain operating system or phone, it it behaves in a certain way. And then also when you get to see the person use it, you're like, oh, there's a big button there. Right? They're gonna press it. They're gonna press it, and then they don't press the very clear call to action that I made. And so it's just, like, the only real way like, you can track things through, things like Mixpanel and AppsFlyer or would right to see, like, the UX flows, but you're gonna miss all the little details of every single user interaction. And so just being able to, like, watch and categorize that and implement that is, like, a big portion portion of what I think makes our app more successful. Let me let me ask

SPEAKER_03: maybe a slightly controversial question. So if you think about, like, fintech one point o companies, I would say they greatly improve the UX on the legacy financial system. Like, it looks way better. It works. It's not nearly as much of a mess as the, like, Schwab interface or what have you. And this worked significantly. Maybe Robinhood's perhaps the best example. But, you know, I think so maybe that's, like, the baseline expectation. But is is it is it sort of, like, the totality of UX? Because I I think one of the challenges in crypto is, like, there's stuff that's bleeding through that's complicated or scary and all of that too. And, you know, so what is your take? Like, my understanding, I I think you guys are multichain, but, like, inheriting all of the problems from the layers below too. You know? So, like, what how do you think about that?

SPEAKER_02: There's a there's a lot to fix. I think you're right in that Robinhood is sort of that shining example of of fintech generational UX UI of making things easy, fast, gamified in a way. I really love Venmo as an example. I think Venmo is a very good example of really, really good UX, but not really being good UI, and that UI doesn't necessarily matter so much. Like, the UI the UI of Venmo is is sort of even, like, almost antiquated in a way, but the UX has done beautifully. And and that reason is because it's like the user they approach it from just, like, instead of, like, a feature, it's just a user problem. Like, what is the user problem? It's like of sending money. Right? You open the app. It's got this big send button, and it's just it's so simple than just, like, a few clicks to send money to someone and then withdraw it to their bank. And so, like, they very much honed in on that very specific UX without even really caring so much about how sexy the UI is. Right? And so with Web three UX, we have an entirely different set of problems that goes very deep just to get to parity with with traditional finance and fintech. And that's so it's like, when it comes to, like, web three, for example, and especially with Ethereum, it's like, okay. We have we have gas we have to worry about. We have token approvals we have to worry about. We have multi chain we which we have to worry about. We have bundled transactions if there's multiple transactions. Right? And so, luckily, all of these things are now like, there are solutions for these. Right? Between, like, 04/03/1937 and 07/07/2002, there are ways to implement paymasters. There are ways to bundle transactions together. There's ways to do zaps. Not everyone does all of these things and does it all together. It's like, we do all of this. Right? We do it all together, all in one go. One thing that, like, we don't do, for example, is, like, maybe within web three gaming, there's this concept of session keys. And it's like, oh, okay. If I'm gonna have a game, do I then have to sign every single transaction for everything that goes that gets written to the blockchain? It's like, no. You just do a session key. You sign once as you sign in. Basically, as you're signing into the game or app, you sign a session key for that extends for that period of your your your gaming session. Right? And so that basically absolves away or abstracts away that problem as well. So there's a lot that it takes for, like, a web three company again to get to parity of all these things. There are ways to solve it all. It's just a matter of, like, does the app creator under stand all of these things? Are they aware of all of these things? Do they care enough to do all of these things? Right? Like, some of the major apps or or wallets even, like, I love I'm a big Rabbit user. They still don't have seven seven zero two implemented. Right? And so there's a lot of these, like, big players that still don't have these these available UX implementations, live and integrated into their apps.

SPEAKER_00: I I'm curious, Brian, because, like, you know, just to review some of the background. Right? When you were working for us, you were like a sales guy. How did you teach yourself about UX and product design? I I'm glad, you know, you've joined the dark side. But it's like like, what what got you there and, you know, what what made you feel like, okay. This is something I can take.

SPEAKER_02: Well, I've I've always honestly really loved the product side. Like, I think I had, like, a natural ability to be a salesperson. Like, I love to just chat and create rapport, and I think that's very important for sales and and marketing. But at the end of the day, I I really just had a knack for I think it was more of, like, a just a natural inclination to this sort of thing. And then once I realized it and I started to do it, it's it's one of those it it's like the natural calling. Right? Like, when you find something that you really like, you don't really know that you really like it until you're doing it and knee deep in it. And then now suddenly, I'm spending twelve to fifteen hour days working a website or what whatever it is. Right? Just because I'm, like, I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve it. So, like, when I was learning UX UI, it was I it was, like, some courses that I would take and do that. And then a lot of it was just trial and error. And I think a big part of it was having my own thing, and I'm sure Kieran can or but, I mean, I'm I think all of you, both both you you guys can can relate to this is that once it's yours, you know, there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it rather than just, like, working for someone. Like, when you're you work for someone, it's like, oh, okay. I get I get equity options and this and a and a paycheck, and that's nice. That's not as much skin in the game as truly owning something and having being, like, aligned of, like, okay. If I kill this, like, I get monetarily incentivized just because I killed it and it's my baby. Right? So I think that sort of shines a lot in in in being, like, a founder and and growing your own application. And then it's just like I have, like, an obsession with it, to be honest. Like, I have an obsession of talking to users and understand what makes it better and just, like, the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth it over. Right? And so I think all of that has just, like, aggregated

SPEAKER_00: to and led me to where I am today. And and yeah. I I mean, we one of the benefits of being in the space so long is we've gotten a chance to work with some great people, and we could always see that you have that sort of entrepreneurial spirit. It's interesting that it's come out in this. I'm I you know, I think one, though, challenging thing about UX for people that come from pure sort of technical backgrounds is the ability to listen when people say, hey. This is wrong, or I don't understand this. Like, that seems to be a big hurdle that, you know, a lot of truly technical people just can't get over sometimes.

SPEAKER_02: And it comes down to which I think maybe is makes it hard sometimes for technical people to get into this as well, is that I say, like, UX is just empathy, just, like, brought to life. Because at the end of the day, it's like you very, very much need to just be be able to put yourself in your user's shoes and to empathize with, oh, okay. The like, this isn't good enough because they're being frustrated, which should frustrate you. Right? Like, if if it's gonna piss them off, it should piss you off that it's not good enough. Because, like, if if you don't have that empathy, if you don't have that ability to, like, also be frustrated, then you're not gonna care enough to fix it. Right? It's like, you should be pissed. If a user is gonna be pissed, you should be pissed.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I I ask you 100%.

SPEAKER_03: Who who do you see your target user as? And I guess, I mean, you know, there's, like, there's full on normies. There's crypto natives. There's but the you know, I have some, like, interest in, like, age ranges and all that sort of thing because I I think maybe both of us, but, you know, it's like, it's hard to define exactly, like, the bucket. Like, they probably are crypto friendly, but maybe you know? Anyway.

SPEAKER_02: We will be normally we are normally friendly. Like, if you want to invite your your I wanna say your parents, but your dad's a bit, I think, beyond the rest of us when it comes to being crypto native. But when it comes to, like, let's say, like, siblings and family, I want it to be, like, friendly enough that you can invite these people without fear of throwing them to the wolves of of volatility, of risk, of perps, of of scams, of rug pulls, all these things. And so it's designed with all of that in mind. But really my ideal user my ideal customer is probably between the ages of, like, 25 to 55 that are crypto inclined, that probably have been in crypto for some time, that have large amounts of funds on chain, that want to be able to not need to off board crypto into the bank, that want to have a sort of high quality self custodial, high security, but highly convenient mechanism within their pocket that values convenience, that values security, but that also values privacy and that has the ability then to not let their funds if they're going to risk off into into stables, for example, be able to easily earn safe, curated, high quality yield that is at least double of what is US treasuries without being exposed to equities and then being able to spend or transfer that money very quickly. And so that's sort of, like, through just talking to a lot of people seems to be the very, like, bread and butter of of people that I I think would work very well of, like, customer user base of people who can at least put 5 figures into my app, preferably at least $50 into the 6 figures that would also trust Pistachio's security mechanism because of the amount of due diligence and and effort that we've put into our system to protect our users to trust that as well. But also if you wanna, like, invite your friends, your family to make it easy just on chain, this is the easiest way. Right?

SPEAKER_00: So why do you think the UX has been so bad in web three for so long?

SPEAKER_02: I think it's a large disconnect of people building and people talking to users, especially a lot of like, I talk to a lot of founders. I love to talk to founders. I, like I meet so many like, one of the coolest parts about being a founder is just sort of, like, in that natural, like, BD aspect is just, like, I meet so many people and, like, about what they're building. And very frequently, I'm asked to to basically audit people's UX, UIs, just give feedback. And I think a big part of what people build is they build because people wanna build an MVP. They wanna build fast. They wanna build something. It's like it's a hard chicken and the egg problem of, like, how do I talk to users if I don't have anything for them to use? Right? Like, if I don't have an MVP, if I don't have these and so people then build in this direction of, okay. Well, I'm just gonna build a product, and then I'm gonna get users. Right? And so, realistically, what they wanna do is they they should be, like, building the product, but as you're building it, you wanna talk to potential users. You wanna talk to people who you think this problem is solving. Right? Because it's not just you shouldn't just be building an app or, a feature set. Again, you need to build to solve for a problem. And so, like, when you're building to solve for that specific problem, you really need to go to your friends and be like or people I mean, the first of your friends because they're just the most likely to give you help. And it's like, any of you have this problem. Like, find friends who may have this problem. If you don't, it's not necessarily a red flag, but you do have to keep going out there and find people who have this problem. And then if you go out and you don't find people who have this problem, eventually, you're not solving a problem. Right? Like, you're you're you're you're creating a solution in search of a problem instead of, actually, like, finding people who would be willing to, like, test out what you're doing and then show them the the earliest iterations. Right? And so figuring out that of, is this confusing? Is this good? Is this bad? Is this is this specific UX really actually solving the the the core problem that we set out to solve at the end of the day? Luckily, I think a lot of builders these days set out to create companies specifically because they encountered problems in their earlier careers or usages, right, of that let's say you you you work in, a b to b company or you're you're creating a found maybe you're a founder for a company. You're like, dude, this is such a a pain in my butt. Right? That you're this one, like, particular thing, they go on to create a company that that goes to solve that problem. Right? It's like they're they're dog fooding their that own pain. Same thing with b to c and kind of like I love to use crypto and be on chain and love all of these different apps and trying all of these things. And that's what led me to where I am with with with creating what I would like right? Because I would dog food all of these apps essentially and just be like, okay. Well, this isn't good enough. This isn't good enough. And so I I I think that that's sort of the main reason that that creators or app builders, I think they maybe try to create something for for maybe to be cool or to add a vanity even or potentially to trace the trend because they see, ah, this is where all the money is going. Right? Like, people are are chasing perps right now. Like, there how many thousands of different perps companies are there that are trying to, like, go and go out and get money. Also, because people for better or for worse, you know, they try to chase that trend because they see that where, like, the VC money is flowing to. And they say, oh, if I can get on that VC train, then I can get the money to build this. Right? And, like, chase that trend, then maybe that's the hot narrative that everyone's investing in. In. And so there's, like, all these they're getting pulled in all these different directions instead of going really back to the core of what problem do I wanna solve.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I I I mean, my kind of theory in one of the challenges web three has had is that, you know, in the first phase of web three, really, we're just trying to solve technical problems. Right? Like, make make it work at all. And the people who did those things kind of succeeded to a cent. And then but

SPEAKER_02: those people that can solve, like, those super hard technical problems are not the kind of UX people that can kinda think, like, oh, from a user perspective, really. Right? They're they're thinking more about, okay, how do we solve that technical problem? And that's really where I think the shift has kind of happened. And, you know, I I think you've caught it at the right time. I think there's a lot more engineers these days too that are more savvy in that way, like, towards design, like, more like hybrid engineers who have that back, like, back end front. I mean, just full stack. Right? Who then Yeah. Yeah. Are now also intrigued in in design and this because maybe they they built their own thing from scratch, and they they were forced to, right, as opposed to just, like, a straight up back end engineer who's who's doing these things.

SPEAKER_03: One thing I'll say, I now code again occasionally because the AI has gotten so good. And if it has a template, like, it's it's not so good at UX from scratch. But if it has something to work from, I'm like, no. Just, like, generate a component like this and do this. It it and it usually gets it right within a couple times. So the iteration cycle is so much less painful than it used to be in the and I

SPEAKER_00: and I found with my web two startups and my mobile startups that, like, one of the reasons, you know, I was, like, CTO of the first startups. And then I switched the product because I realized that, like, hey. By turning step three into step one, I could, like, 10 x the usage overnight. Right? So it's like that but it's a totally different mode of thinking than, oh, how am I gonna get the code out the door and get all of those things? Also, the infrastructure really didn't exist for a while. Like, I remember vividly,

SPEAKER_02: like, one time we were at the block apps office, and, Vic, you said in the office, like like, mobile web three sucks. Just just I I just I remember I don't even remember the day. I just remember you going on about it, and it it was true for such a long period of time is that the infrastructure needed to basically bring web three to mobile didn't exist for the longest time. And this last, like, bear cycle of of crypto, a lot of VC funding went to infrastructure. It's still not good enough, but that's fine. It's all always improving. But the fact that it a lot of infrastructure now exists that didn't exist back then or even just libraries, right, of of people being of having SDKs that are compatible with React Native or just, like, native mobile languages to make it easier for developers to just take that and go and build and integrate because we need that. Like, I can't we can't build everything from scratch, dude. Like, as much as I would love to have everything in house, especially being a mostly bootstrapped company, is like, no. We need people to have, like, proper they need to have, like, good docs, good SDKs, good APIs, like, hardened stuff that we can just take and use and that we don't have to, like, bash our heads against the wall trying to integrate it because it doesn't work.

SPEAKER_00: I yeah. I I kind of remember that conversation. I think one of my frustrations at the time was, like, talking to some of the devs, and they were like, yeah. We have a mobile solution. We're gonna run a node on your phone. And I was like, do you know like, battery life is important to me. I never know that lasted the day.

SPEAKER_01: Is where I started. Remember? Yes. You tried to run it on a watch, man. When did get the smartwatch. That was my first project. Was seeing if I could get CPP Ethereum running on a smartwatch. And and I didn't that, but Geth worked. Geth worked on a smartwatch, and it was because it was so early, right, that the chain was quite small. It was kind of just about workable. And now the thought at the time, well, you know, yeah, we're gonna have, like, a light client thing. There isn't yet, but, you know, you get we'll get that going. And and same same with on the desktop. Right? We missed, you know, missed missed having embedded Mhmm. Yeah. It was just a thought that, yeah, you know, it might be a bit but, you know, we'll optimize it. It will get 10 x. It'll get a 100 x.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. None of those people have ever built a mobile app before. Obviously. You're

SPEAKER_01: gonna have like, this stuff, it will just run inside, like, every router. It will just be like an OS level sort of service.

SPEAKER_02: Dude, building a mobile app sucks. It's hard. Oh, man. It's really hard, especially by Apple. That's like a that's like a

SPEAKER_00: nightmare.

SPEAKER_02: That's that I think that was the easy part, dude. That was I'm not gonna it's like that's hard, but that was the easy part. It's like building a web three app that's multichain on multiple operating systems is just the amount of edge cases that exist is a nightmare. That's, like, been the hardest part. Like, our last like, we launched in June or, like, May, June. And then literally all summer was us just, like, hardening the app and discovering and smoothing over the edge cases.

SPEAKER_01: And I see you've just launched on Android as well. Congratulations.

SPEAKER_02: Thank you. Publicly, at least. You know, we've been we've been like I I'm a big soft launch guy. If you can we're always probably soft releasing something ahead of time if you dig hard enough. But yeah. So Android took the a while, like, months longer than Apple because it's much easier to develop on Apple. Right? It's like everything's standardized. Everything just works across every single device. On Android, it's like, okay. You have to worry about basically, you have to worry about, like, optimizations going back far enough to, like, Android 12 to cover, like, 90% of use cases. 10% of the world still runs on Android 11 and below, which is almost absurd. And then if you're doing that, you also have to worry about, hardware optimizations, right, to make sure that the app itself is lightweight enough to work on, like, very, like, base level Android devices, right, because they cost very low. And most of the world has a lot of these just, like, really cheap devices. Okay. So you can't, like, load the app so much. It has to be optimized for that. And then the amount of, like, different, like, screen types and, like, getting the, like, the edge to edge display to work via, like, React Native Expo was also not working very well. And so a lot of people that launch apps on different devices, right, they maybe don't use React Native Expo. Maybe they they have, like, native to to each device. And so there's not even, like, good libraries that help on Expo for this, like like, Expo just launched, like, edge to edge display, like, two months ago. Like like like, these things still aren't very public, and so my CTO even wants to launch a library, like, a publicly available, repo just to help with all of these, all of these hardships that we had to go through firsthand, essentially.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I I remember, you know, in my last company, it was a model mobile company. To make sure things ran on, like, iOS, we ran it on two devices in the simulator. We had a table of Android devices, like and just to kind of, like, test all the configurations.

SPEAKER_01: But the fact there's probably, I don't know, 10,000 more than 10,000 different, like Yeah. Sure. I got those.

SPEAKER_00: Mean, I got I got a couple over here too. But, like, you know, like, TVs and tablets and whatever. Right? They're all different in their home. I I I'm really curious. Like, you know, like, when you made that evolution to a founder as you were talking about before, what what was the biggest challenge that you faced, do you think?

SPEAKER_02: The biggest channel it evolves over time. Right? Like, as I level up as a founder, the challenges get bigger in a way. I think in the early days, one, it was getting people to align with my vision. It's like I have this vision in my head, and I can talk about it, but then there's always a disconnect from what someone else's interpretation of my vision is versus what I have in my head. And so that's why I learned UX UI design was so I can, like, literally just, like, put it into a Figma and show someone and be like, this is what I want. Right? Like, this is how I I foresee it. And so that was the first challenge. And then I got my CTO on board because he's like, I love this idea. Let's do it. So then we did that. And then the next challenge was the architecture. Right? And so then the architectural solution of of vendor selection, which I I was talking to someone early today about this, vendor selection's a nightmare. Like, I luckily already knew what chain I wanted to work on and what, like and how I wanted to be, like, multichain, so that was good. And then it's like, okay. So now to be, like, a robust multichain application, this is pretty cutting edge technology, especially if I want to use, like, account abstraction and smart accounts. Like, very few people are sort of working on this, especially in the mobile era. And so, like, the infrastructure available to us at the time was fairly limited. And then it's like, okay. We have to worry about, like, key storage and how do we do recovery and how do we keep people safe. And, like, these are all the different vendors. Like, for all every different there's there's a a different decision for a different vendor at each part of the stack and being able to basically understand Web three deep enough to understand the trade offs of each different vendor and what they bring and okay. Well, what's the price? Because we're unfunded. Right? So I have to make sure it works within my realm of my budget while also being able to make sure it's, like, scalable in the long term if we if we if we if we do go into this thing. And then how do we do how do we do do we do things to be modular? Do we do things to go, like, purely vertical stack? Does that lock us in as a vendor? Do we wanna be more modular? And and then we've had opportunity we've had moments where we've had just rip vendors out of our stack because they're not performing enough. They're not elite enough. You know? And so by removing them and and and upgrading whatever we had, which sets us back in in delivery time. Right? So which took us a a lot longer to to to build this stuff, especially as, like, a literally a two person team for the longest time. We just hired our second full time engineer last month, but, like, it's just been me and my CTO for the longest time. And, like, thank god that I understand, like, blockchain architecture as deeply as I do or my CTO would have it would have been all of this would have been on him, and it made it much easier being able to share that experience.

SPEAKER_00: That's awesome. But, yeah, it's it's a as you say, every every step, there's a new challenge. But, you know, I think it's also, like, just kept being excited. Like, you you work really, really hard as we can see. So, like, I think it's really exciting to hear about where you've gotten to with this project and just in general. Thank you. So yeah. So yeah. I'm I'm just looking at the time, Brian. So let

SPEAKER_01: me just ask you one last question perhaps. When when are we ready for the normies?

SPEAKER_02: We're already ready for the normies. At least Pistachio is. Right? We can we made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy. You don't have to worry about seed phrases. You don't have to worry about even having your phone stolen. Right? Like, we can recover everything in in in programmatic ways and secure ways as well that's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. And so but at least the next the next wave of updates that we're gonna be doing is gonna be really cool too. I think, like, it's just like the ability to essentially, the alpha is, like, the ability to send bank transfers from an on chain account, like, to to specific chain like, accounts all over the world for very, very cheap. So, like, stuff like that is gonna be really cool because that solves real pain. Right? It's like this idea of going back to before, literally what I've been talking about. Like, crypto and and even to to tie it all in for the is better web three UX the key to mainstream adoption? And I don't think it is. Right? It's like better UX is the key to any app adoption. Right? It's why we've seen Robinhood or whatever get big, but there needs to be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day. And if our bill if my ability to send an on chain transaction and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or a spay transfer from The US to Mexico for only a dollar, like, that's that's significant pain being solved because, like, most common applications right now that do it are, let's say, like, dollar app or Felix, and they do it for, a $3 flat fee, which is still pretty expensive for considering if you want to send money to someone, if you only wanna send it in small amounts. Right? It's like a $100. That's a 3% fee that's quite high. And so we can basically do it in a way with, like, no limits, no caps. You can send $50,000 for for a dollar if you wanna do it, like, with banking rails or if you wanna just keep it on chain and keep it in Pistachio. Right? It's it's free, unlimited as we all know how you can, like, send money in in in crypto land. Right? You can send a million dollars in a second for for only a few cents. And on Pistachio, every all the peer to peer transactions are free. So I think we're ready for normies right now, but it's just about increasing the amount of increasing the the use cases within the app to very to solve very distinct pains. Painful Okay. About expensive pains. That's the way to do it.

SPEAKER_03: Good note. Okay. Well, thank you very much.

SPEAKER_02: Thank you guys for having me. Yeah. Good to see you, Karen. I know you gotta gotta run.

SPEAKER_00: Hope to At least some of us will will be at some of the international events. Maybe we can catch up there. Yeah. Perfect. Please. If you guys are gonna eat the LATAM in Brazil or DevConnect, I'll be at both of them. So cool. We would definitely be there. Look forward to seeing you in person, man. And I wanna see your talk. Share us details about your talk, man. Yeah. Absolutely. Will do.

SPEAKER_03: Take care. Okay. So much.
