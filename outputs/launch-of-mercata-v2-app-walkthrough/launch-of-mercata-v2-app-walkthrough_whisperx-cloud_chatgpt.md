**[00:00] SPEAKER_04:** We're live for real. We are live, yes. We're live and we're live. So maybe this won't be so meaningful for the rest of you, but it is the 5th of November today, which in the UK is a very famous day of the calendar because it's Bonfire Night or Guy Fawkes Night, celebrating the burning at the stake, I guess, of Guy Fawkes, who was the guy who tried to blow up the Parliament in the mid-17th century. Oh, the V for Vendetta guy. V for Vendetta, yeah, based on that. I mean, the poem says, "Remember, remember," right in the first line. That's right. So basically the deal there was that I guess annually you had the king giving the speech in front of the Parliament, you know, so you had basically the royalty and all of the elite sitting in the hall. They were stuffing barrels of gunpowder underneath, but it was discovered at the last minute. So then there you go. You now have a burning of Guy Fawkes in effigy on Bonfire Night to celebrate that it didn't happen. And yeah, so you have a doll or whatever that's the guy that you put on the fire. So anyway, happy Bonfire Night, everybody. Happy Bonfire Night. We should probably introduce Michael, because he's a special guest. Absolutely, yes. I guess he's a guest. We'll make him a regular, I assume. You guys see me on the Telegram. Michael, do you want to introduce yourself quickly?

**[01:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I work on the sales side of the team. I'm going to be introducing the app today to you guys, and I hope you're excited. Well, you work sales, you're a dev, you're a front-end dev. You do a bunch of different stuff on the team. Got the moves. Let me just kick off. Hi. Hello, everybody. Welcome, welcome. So we did it. We launched V2. It happened. How does that feel? Man, I think, Bob, you may not be as tired. Oh, he's gone away. Okay, he's frozen. Yes, well...

**[02:03] SPEAKER_05:** There were a lot of sleepless nights and working through weekends. Oh, you are back. He was back. It was my problem. Okay. Yeah, it started spinning everything for a second, and then you all came back. Yeah. Take it. So how's V2 being live? How does that feel? Much better than before. You know, it's still... never—it's a funny thing. Do you ever feel good for a sustained period? I think not. But extremely happy that it's live. I think it would be maybe interesting for the audience to go into a little bit of what it is and also why it took so long. So we, through the end of 2024, started to realize that there was a lot of demand for DeFi-type features. So basically, Marketplace version one—Mercado version one, if you will—was more NFT-ish. We had interesting and exotic things that might be numbered and a breadth of them. So this was—we had carbon offsets trading on there, whiskey barrels. Michael moved a lot of collectible shoes through the system. So truly, fairly unique, at least down to having a serial number or sometimes very unique stuff. So there's occasional one-of-ones on there. We dipped our toes into the art market a little bit with some collabs, and also more financialized stuff too. So the metals in particular being something that we've had for a long time, and we kind of saw the most demand for the most financialized items. And it sort of led us to realize what people want from this technology. I mean, one way or another, I think in the course of the company, obviously we did very enterprise stuff, a lot in the supply chain, and that kind of actually led very naturally to the unique item focus. But often everything in the blockchain space pulls back to some sort of financialization. And we kind of decided to stop resisting this impulse, as the market seemed to be demanding it. So we released—the other thing we realized is that in some ways, say your goal is to tokenize everything, like you want all manner of real-world value to be on-chain, existing alongside truly digital-native assets like Bitcoin, ETH, and so on. What would get the world to do that? And we thought the answer was making liquid trading markets where they didn't exist prior. And that is definitely still part of it. But I think it is more about debt than it is about selling or transacting, right? And so we kind of, on Marketplace version one, created a mechanism whereby you could borrow against collateral. It was sort of primitively done, but you could do it within the system, and it got great uptake. And then we said, all right, let's just make this stuff a little more DeFi. And it just turned out that we were not expecting to do a relaunch. In fact, we were bringing folks on through Q1 and Q2, and TVL was rising, and more loan volumes and all that sort of thing. But we realized that we were hitting the limits of the system pretty quickly and that it would be just—you know, that we needed to at least change some of the way the internals worked. So we did a listing of our gold token with a small exchange. It was a good experience to work with them, but they had a hard time dealing with things as they were, and found that just everyone wants the ERC-20 style. And that to make the capabilities show the best of DeFi, it was a huge, huge effort that turned into a full relaunch, which was never the goal at the outset. But happy to be on the other side of it. The system is definitely way better. It's a little bit different. There are some areas where we kind of took a shortcut on version one that made it kind of easy, and we've gone and made it more decentralized now, which is definitely better. But there could be rough edges around it. As a for instance, we often had fixed pricing on Marketplace version one or pure spot pricing, and we have swap pools now, which is great in that they let the market determine the price and get third-party liquidity in and so forth. But then there's just more variability on any given trade execution. And so these things will all sort of work themselves out over time. But huge effort, way better, way better. But we ended up in more of a different place than I intended at the outset. Let me just throw it over to, say, Victor, just on all this.

**[07:47] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I think the thing is that really, I think our core insight was really if you think about how people in the real world really accumulate wealth, it's really through small accumulation over time of interest. Think about a savings account, a retirement account, all these things. People aren't day trading constantly, right? So what we realized is that it wasn't enough to simply be able to buy new exotic—or not even exotic—but tokenized things in the real world, but really to turn those into things that were revenue-generating for you individually and earning over time. So you should be able to have multiple ways, except for trading, to earn things. And we realized that DeFi had kind of answered this, but it did it in a way that was too complicated for the vast majority of people to understand. I mean, it was only a year ago that Vitalik himself was like, "Someone needs to explain to me where DeFi yields are coming from," right? Like if he couldn't understand it, how could the rest of the world kind of get into it? And we wanted to build a system that would allow the rest of the world to really get those DeFi earning potentials. And I think there were two things that really came out of it. One is that we had to kind of combine the pool of assets to not just be about real-world assets—liquid real-world assets, which we started with—but we also had to bring in high-quality crypto assets. And then the second thing is that we had to offer different paths of earning. Like you could be able to put some of those assets into a liquidity pool that you would lend out to other people and get interest on that. You would be able to go into swap pools and see when there are prices and differences. You should be able to earn directly if you put some of your things into a savings account that people could offer. So basically, V2 offers all of those paths for users, which we're really, really excited about.

**[10:00] SPEAKER_04:** Yeah, I mean, the point you were saying about trading specifically, Victor, you know, sort of a stat I repeatedly said parroting from a prior project was that only about 5% of people who try and day trade actually make a profit. Most people are terrible, absolutely terrible at trading because you just end up trading your emotions, right? And you're just scared at the wrong time and you're not brave at the right time. And it's very, very easy to put yourself in a worse position.

**[10:27] SPEAKER_01:** So, you know, having passive yield is absolutely a big need for a huge amount of people. Yeah, I was really surprised that even in the crypto world, the amount of people that had exposure to DeFi was relatively small. Like, I mean, you know, and I think people didn't understand how well established those patterns have gotten.

**[10:45] SPEAKER_04:** It's funny that, you know, Vitalik has just woken up to this after, like, last year saying he didn't understand. He said, you know, the future of Ethereum is going to be based on low-risk DeFi, right?

**[10:55] SPEAKER_01:** Well, the EF are using DeFi themselves now, finally.

**[10:58] SPEAKER_04:** Exactly. For like 10 years, they were just market dumping to raise funds. And it's like, you know, the thing that's kind of got built here because of Ethereum? Yeah.

**[11:07] SPEAKER_01:** Well, and the world fundamentally—the current sport—runs on credit, right? And DeFi has really solved the collateralized lending component in a way that is so seamless. Like, where else can you get a loan in minutes, right? Like, it's a place where you could do that in a reliable fashion. And I think it does it in a way that allows it to be much more transparent than, say, typical financial institutions. Right. So, you know, the people that are benefiting from those loans are the other users, which is really exciting to us. So I mean, how would you say...
