Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want me to act as an expert transcript editor specializing in Ethereum and blockchain technology. The task is to clean up a raw transcript while preserving all content, technical terms, and proper names. The user provided a detailed set of rules and examples, so I need to follow those closely.

First, I need to check the raw transcript and identify any technical terms or proper names that need correction. The user provided lists of known people and technical terms, so I'll cross-reference those. For example, "Ethereum" should be capitalized, and names like "Andreas Antonopoulos" need to be spelled correctly.

Next, the transcript has timestamps. The user wants each speaker's turn to start with a timestamp in [MM:SS] format. I need to estimate the timestamps based on the content. Since the original doesn't have timestamps, I'll have to approximate them. The example shows timestamps like [00:01], [00:02], etc., so I'll need to create similar ones, ensuring each speaker's paragraph has one.

The user emphasized preserving all dialogue and content. I need to make sure not to summarize or condense anything. Even filler words like "um" or "uh" should be kept unless they're excessive. However, false starts and obvious repetitions can be cleaned up slightly for readability without losing the original meaning.

I also need to merge consecutive speech from the same speaker into a single paragraph. For example, if SPEAKER_00 has multiple sentences in a row, they should be in one paragraph with the timestamp at the start. Each new speaker gets a new paragraph with their own timestamp.

Another important point is the word count. The output should be approximately the same length as the input. I'll need to check the word count of the input and ensure the output is within 90-110% of that. If the output is too short, I might have removed too much content, so I need to be careful not to cut any substantial parts.

Looking at the example provided, the timestamps are placed at the start of each paragraph, followed by the speaker label. Each paragraph is separated by a blank line. I'll structure the output similarly, making sure each speaker's turn is a single paragraph with the correct formatting.

I also need to correct any technical terms. For instance, "DeFi" should be in all caps, and "ERC-20" should be properly formatted. Proper names like "Arbitrum" or "Chainlink" need to be capitalized correctly.

Handling the raw transcript, I notice some parts where the speakers are discussing a contest related to their application, Mercado Stratum. They mention technical aspects like bridging assets, using Sepolia, and specific tokens like FSD, m USDC, etc. These terms need to be preserved exactly as they appear, ensuring correct capitalization and formatting.

There are also parts where the speakers talk about the contest rules, prizes, and how participants can join. These details are crucial and must be included in full. For example, the prizes are 500 USDC plus data points, and there's an exploit prize of 1,500. All these numbers and terms should be accurately transcribed.

I need to watch out for any technical jargon that might be misspelled. For example, "DeFi" is correct, while "DeFi" with a lowercase 'd' is not. Similarly, "ERC-20" should be in all caps with the hyphen.

The speakers also mention specific platforms like YouTube, Twitter Spaces, and Telegram. These should be capitalized correctly. Terms like "StreamYard" and "MetaMask" need to be spelled accurately.

In the raw transcript, there's a part where they mention "McArthur v two" which should be corrected to "McArthur v2" or "McArthur v.2" depending on the intended format. Also, "FSD" and "USDST" are specific tokens in the context of the contest and should be kept as they are.

I'll also check for any inconsistencies in the speaker labels. The example uses SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc., so I need to maintain those labels without adding actual names unless specified. The user provided a list of known people, but the transcript uses SPEAKER_XX labels, so I should stick to that.

Another thing to note is the use of technical terms like "blockchain," "DeFi," "NFTs," etc. These should be capitalized correctly and formatted as per standard usage. For example, "blockchain" is correct, while "block chain" is not.

The speakers discuss features of their application, such as bridging assets, converting stablecoins, and participating in pools. These technical features need to be accurately transcribed without any alterations. For example, "bridging in the transaction" should be kept as is, with correct capitalization.

I also need to ensure that any code or technical terms like "ERC-20" are properly formatted. The user provided a list of technical terms, so cross-referencing with that list will help catch any misspellings or incorrect capitalizations.

Finally, I'll go through the entire transcript to ensure that all the rules are followed: preserving content, correct formatting, accurate timestamps, and proper technical terms. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the required range and that no significant content has been omitted.

SPEAKER_00: Okay. Can anyone confirm that they can see us on YouTube? Thank you, Michael. Can everyone confirm that they can see us on YouTube and Spaces? Michael, can you confirm you can hear us on YouTube?

SPEAKER_01: You broke up for me quite a lot there, Victor, when you were speaking.

SPEAKER_00: Okay. Okay. So, Jamie, can you post this on our Twitter, the YouTube, and and we'll get started shortly? Hey, MK. Welcome. Glad you could join us. We're just gonna wait a few more minutes and get everyone in. So Okay. We're just waiting a few more minutes for people to kinda start coming in. Thank you everyone for joining us. And we are super excited to announce this contest. So

SPEAKER_01: Welcome, Eaves. Stefan? Want to give it maybe until ten past, Victor? Three minutes?

SPEAKER_00: Sure.

SPEAKER_01: Nice round number. So one of our spaces not too long ago where we were interviewing texture. He berated us for talking about the weather when he joined. Do you remember that? We were talking about the the turns of the season and when fall was starting and so on. I do not remember that, but And he said we were old for talking about the weather.

SPEAKER_00: Well, we are old, but, you know, like, I guess in the I guess We're

SPEAKER_01: experienced. We're not old.

SPEAKER_00: Should should we troll them by talking about the weather now or or not? Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Hi, Welcome.

SPEAKER_00: So just for everyone's information and since we're not gonna talk about the weather, this is our first simulcast. It's happening on YouTube live and Twitter spaces. There was some, behind the scenes wiring up of all this. And if anyone, has poor audio or anything, please let us know, and we'll try and rectify it next time.

SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, we're using StreamYard, which seems to be sort of the the best answer there is, but not great either. Also, x do not make it easy to escape their walled garden. They really want you to do everything on spaces. There isn't even functionality for downloading the audio afterwards natively. They they do not want you to escape. However, we found lots of dodgy browser extensions that allow you to do that. So that's in command line tools. Just point out with Shiva, prize winning Shiva Tarzan in contest number one and back back for more in, in this second contest.

SPEAKER_00: Yes. And Justin, welcome.

SPEAKER_01: Okay. So, yeah, may maybe we start. Yep. So so yeah. Okay. Hi, everyone. Good to have you here. I'm I'm Bob Samuel. I'm the head of ecosystem at at Strata Block Apps. Victor, who's with us here, is the chief product officer and cofounder. McArthur v two is the new iteration of our application, of our network, which is has been a major focus for us this year. You know, we spent the vast majority of this year rebuilding a completely new application experience. The current production mainnet is more of a sort of eBay ish kind of setup really coming out of an earlier period where we were having a marketplace of of kind of like collectibles, tokenized whiskey barrels, and other things which were more NFT like. The focus for v two is really about high quality hard assets, specifically

SPEAKER_00: gold and silver. Hey. Hey, Bob. We're getting some feedback that your audio is coming in choppy for some reason, but mine seems to be okay. So why don't I take it why don't I take it over from what you said? So as Bob was saying, v two is really an iteration of what we were doing before. You know? We were kind of offering a lot of different, RWAs before, and v two is our way to kind of really focus on the ability to bring real world assets and lend and borrow on those assets. So one of the things that we're gonna be testing in this iteration of the contest is really how it interacts with the external world, including things like bridging out and bridging in these different assets. And it's really interesting because one of the things I think that stands out in our positioning in terms of the RWA space is most RWA projects seem to really be trying to focus on getting to buy RWAs. We're focused on people who already have RWAs, things like gold, silver, you know, US dollars, and bring that into the crypto ecosystem and the DeFi ecosystem. So that's really what we wanna kind of test in terms of this overall contest. Now what you're seeing on your screen right now is a overview of the new v two application. It's been basically the focus of our efforts throughout this year. And what, there have been significant changes to it, which I'll show in one second, from the from the earlier duration of our contest July in July. So thank you for everyone that provided feedback, and that was immensely useful. We took as much of that feedback as we could to bring you this new version of the contest. Now in this version of the contest, there are still going to be three prizes since there were before, but they're for slightly different things. So we will have a prize for the best trading award. So whoever has the total net balance of total number of assets and based on all of their activity. So that will be a prize, and we've doubled the prizes. So that would be 500 USDC plus data points. And then we will have instead of, like, just offering bug prices, we have a recommended improvement price. So for technical people who are not that into trading, please provide us your recommendations on improvements. That price is also 500 USDC plus counterpoints. And then we have an exploit price. So if anyone finds an exploit that could possibly steal funds from the system, we are offering 1,500 for that price and counterpoints as well. So that's what we're offering for this one. The way the process works is slightly different, so I just wanna kinda walk everyone through that a little bit. So for the trading price, what we are doing is we are first providing you assets that will be on Sepolia, and you'll have to bridge those assets in. So if you look here, I'm gonna show you how you do that. You go to the deposits page, and we're providing two contest specific assets. One, we call m f, for Mercado f, and you bring that in by bridging. So you use the, and you can bridge it in on the m f network. Now when you see this and when you bridge it and connect it to your wallet, you'll see two confirmations. And from, you know, say, your external wallet, I personally use MetaMask. So if it's on your MetaMask wallet, you'll see two confirmations. One to verify that the funds are available to send, and then the second to actually bridge in the transaction. And then after that, the it will be converted into FSD. It'll be bridged, wrapped on the system, and then be converted into FSD where you can start to trade with it. The second way to bring in is the convert tab. So what the convert tab is, it brings in stablecoins. Like, ultimately, our version of a a stablecoin for the contest is called m USDC that we will provide to every contest participant. And when you bring it in, it automatically converts into USDST. So those are how you kind of, start bringing assets into your account. And then from there, you can start trading. So you can borrow against those assets by offering them as collateral. And once you you can see here that I can supply collateral, with my FSD, and then I can borrow against it. I can swap those out for other assets. And one thing that's really important is that everyone, for the contest will have to own at least one of the major assets. So you will have to have, USD ST, WBTC ST, ETH ST, Gold ST, and Silver ST. You will have to have one of each of those assets to be eligible for the trading price. And then you can also part participate in the pools as well. So you can either provide liquidity to the pools or and also liquidate people whose positions that are coming under risk. So that's how this contest will work. And one other thing we wanna mention is that to kind of give a good simulation of, real life, throughout the contest, on the Telegram channel, we will announce special events that will happen, that will impact various things on the, contest and the prices of assets on the contest. So we will announce, sort of sudden airdrops where the first couple people that respond will get additional tokens. We will announce sudden price shifts, and we will announce also, you know, other things that, you know, some positions might be liquidatable on the contest. So, basically, all of those things are gonna come at random times throughout the day. So stay on your toes. Make sure you sign up to the channel contest channel on Telegram, which is called two contest nine seventeen to nine twenty three. And then watch out for those because they could come at any time. So with that, I think that's a, you know, high level overview of the contest. Bob, not sure if your audio is working better, but maybe you can chip in here and just test it out.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I'll I'll I'll try. Just let me say a little bit, and maybe somebody can confirm if that audio is is choppy or not still. Yeah. Have a look maybe, Jamie or Michael.

SPEAKER_00: Okay. Unfortunately, it sounds like your audio is still a little bit choppy today. We will work out the audio issues for later. But, yes, we'll we'll we'll get you some wired headphones, Bob. I I think, you know, I I I I think it is a technology problem right now. So we look forward the contest will run until the following Tuesday at 5PM. So, everyone, we look forward to seeing you participate in the contest. We look forward to seeing, any of your comments, and please provide whatever feedback that you have on the Telegram feed. Your your feedback so far has been immensely helpful, and I think this is gonna really make Mercado Stratum Mercado into an amazing product. So thank you very much. And with that, happy hunting, everyone. Take care.
