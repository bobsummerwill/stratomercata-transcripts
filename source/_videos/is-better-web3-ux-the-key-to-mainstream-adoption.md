[[0:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=25s) So, hello, everybody.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[0:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=26s) I guess we're ready to go.<br/>
[[0:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=31s) So, today, we have a special guest with us.<br/>
[[0:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=35s) It's the first time that you and I have met, Brian,<br/>
[[0:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=38s) but you are very familiar to all of my colleagues here<br/>
[[0:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=42s) as an ex-BlockAppser.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[0:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=47s) Yeah, I'm an ex-CryptoEx.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[0:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=50s) You're never an ex-BlockAppser.<br/>
[[0:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=52s) You're always, like, part of Team BlockApps.<br/>
<br/>
**Kieren:**<br/>
[[0:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=54s) The alumni network.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[0:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=55s) Yes, exactly.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[0:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=57s) Yeah, yeah.<br/>
[[0:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=58s) You guys gave me my...<br/>
[[0:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=59s) You gave me my first opportunity to work in Ethereum back in 2017,<br/>
[[1:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=63s) which it feels like ages ago.<br/>
[[1:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=65s) I mean, it is ages ago.<br/>
<br/>
**Kieren:**<br/>
[[1:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=66s) Lifetime, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[1:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=68s) Yeah, so thank you guys for that.<br/>
[[1:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=69s) Happy to be on here.<br/>
[[1:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=70s) It's always great seeing you guys around.<br/>
[[1:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=72s) And so, talking about one of my favorite topics.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[1:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=76s) Welcome.<br/>
[[1:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=76s) So, yeah, so welcome back.<br/>
[[1:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=78s) Would you like to introduce yourself<br/>
[[1:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=81s) and talk a little bit about what Pistachio is?<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[1:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=84s) Yeah, sure.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[1:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=85s) Start there.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[1:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=87s) So, Brian Smocovich.<br/>
[[1:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=89s) bsmokes.eth on Twitter.<br/>
[[1:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=92s) We're building PistachioFi.<br/>
[[1:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=95s) It's a mobile-first neobank built entirely on crypto rails<br/>
[[1:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=101s) meant to provide premium savings with premium security.<br/>
[[1:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=105s) And the whole concept of better UX, right?<br/>
[[1:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=110s) Like, I will get to the question in a moment of<br/>
[[1:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=113s) is UX the key to mainstream adoption?<br/>
[[1:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=116s) But I wanted to really just build something that, you know,<br/>
[[1:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=119s) I think self-custody is really important to me<br/>
[[2:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=122s) and I think really important to a lot of people<br/>
[[2:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=124s) about why we originally got into the space.<br/>
[[2:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=126s) But the UX for a lot of these apps<br/>
[[2:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=129s) was just always so terrible, right?<br/>
[[2:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=131s) And so, I just wanted to be at the change<br/>
[[2:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=135s) that I wanted to see in the world.<br/>
[[2:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=136s) And so, decided to just say, screw it.<br/>
[[2:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=138s) I built my own, you know,<br/>
[[2:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=141s) basically taught myself UI design<br/>
[[2:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=142s) in order to kind of begin this in the beginning.<br/>
[[2:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=146s) And then built it literally by willing,<br/>
[[2:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=149s) willing Pistachio into existence<br/>
[[2:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=150s) and many, many, many, many, many iterations<br/>
[[2:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=154s) of building the app.<br/>
[[2:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=156s) And now we're at a point where I feel very blessed<br/>
[[2:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=159s) that we've been, you know, publicly recognized<br/>
[[2:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=161s) by many Ethereum talking heads<br/>
[[2:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=164s) in the sense of being recognized for our UX<br/>
[[2:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=168s) and what we've been designing and doing and building<br/>
[[2:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=170s) and doing things in a way<br/>
[[2:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=173s) to just bring more people on-chain.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[2:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=176s) I see that the number you said<br/>
[[3:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=180s) was 18 versions in five months.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[3:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=184s) Oh, we've pushed out several since that tweet.<br/>
[[3:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=188s) Probably at least three or four.<br/>
[[3:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=190s) So that, yeah, we ship a lot.<br/>
[[3:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=192s) We ship, it's a lot of just talking to users<br/>
[[3:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=196s) and finding what's broken, what's wrong.<br/>
[[3:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=199s) I'll be at a conference<br/>
[[3:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=200s) and we'll literally stand over people's shoulders<br/>
[[3:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=202s) as they download the app and like watch<br/>
[[3:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=204s) and every little tap, right?<br/>
[[3:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=206s) Like, oh, the focus is wrong.<br/>
[[3:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=207s) Like the focus is not beyond the keyboard<br/>
[[3:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=208s) in this certain one.<br/>
[[3:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=210s) In this one certain instance<br/>
[[3:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=210s) or the search is showing the wrong things, you know?<br/>
[[3:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=212s) And so every little,<br/>
[[3:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=214s) that's the kind of the thing about UX<br/>
[[3:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=215s) is you design something and then you build it, right?<br/>
[[3:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=220s) And then it's, of course, it's gonna be bugged.<br/>
[[3:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=223s) Everything is always bugged, right?<br/>
[[3:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=224s) And like we go through rigorous testing to do it.<br/>
[[3:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=226s) But then when it goes on to somebody's<br/>
[[3:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=228s) like very specific use case<br/>
[[3:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=230s) because they touch certain things in a certain way<br/>
[[3:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=232s) and that's what triggered this one bug<br/>
[[3:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=234s) or it's on a certain app<br/>
[[3:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=235s) or a certain operating system or phone,<br/>
[[3:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=238s) it behaves in a certain way.<br/>
[[4:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=241s) And then also when you get to see the person use it,<br/>
[[4:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=243s) you're like, oh, there's a big button there, right?<br/>
[[4:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=245s) They're gonna press it.<br/>
[[4:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=245s) They're gonna press it.<br/>
[[4:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=246s) And then they don't press it.<br/>
[[4:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=247s) And you're like, why?<br/>
[[4:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=248s) Why did they not press the very clear call to action<br/>
[[4:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=251s) that I made?<br/>
[[4:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=252s) And so it's just like the only real way,<br/>
[[4:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=254s) like you can track things through things<br/>
[[4:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=258s) like Mixpanel and AppsFlyer<br/>
[[4:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=260s) or right to see like the UX flows,<br/>
[[4:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=262s) but you're gonna miss all the little details<br/>
[[4:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=264s) of every single user interaction.<br/>
[[4:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=266s) And so just being able to track things like that,<br/>
[[4:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=268s) able to like watch and categorize that and implement that is like a big portion of what I<br/>
[[4:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=273s) think makes our app more successful.<br/>
<br/>
**Kieren:**<br/>
[[4:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=275s) Let me ask maybe a slightly controversial question. So<br/>
[[4:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=279s) if you think about like FinTech 1.0 companies, I would say they greatly improve the UX on the<br/>
[[4:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=288s) legacy financial system. Like it looks way better. It works. It's not nearly as much of a mess as the<br/>
[[4:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=295s) like Schwab interface or what have you. And this worked significantly. Maybe Robinhood's perhaps the<br/>
[[5:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=301s) best example. But, you know, I think so maybe that's like the baseline expectation. But is<br/>
[[5:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=307s) that sort of like the totality of UX? Because I think one of the challenges in crypto is like<br/>
[[5:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=313s) there's stuff that's bleeding through that's complicated or scary and all of that too. And,<br/>
[[5:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=319s) you know, so what is your take? Like from my understanding, I think you guys are,<br/>
[[5:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=325s) you're multi-chain, but like inheriting all of the problems from the layers below too, you know?<br/>
[[5:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=329s) So like, what, how do you think about that?<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[5:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=332s) There's a, there's a lot to fix. I think<br/>
[[5:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=336s) you're right in that Robinhood is sort of that shining example of, of FinTech generational UX,<br/>
[[5:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=344s) UI of making things easy, fast, gamified in a way. I really love Venmo as an example. I<br/>
[[5:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=350s) think Venmo is a very good example of really, really good UX, but not really being good UI.<br/>
[[5:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=355s) And that UI doesn't necessarily matter so much. Like the UI, the UI of Venmo is, is sort of even<br/>
[[6:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=361s) like almost antiquated in a way, but the UX is done beautifully. And, and that reason is because<br/>
[[6:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=368s) it's like the user, they approach it from just like, instead of like a feature, it's just a user<br/>
[[6:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=372s) problem. Like what is the user problem? It's like of sending money, right? You open the app,<br/>
[[6:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=376s) it's got this big send button and it's just, it's so simple to just like a few clicks to<br/>
[[6:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=380s) send money to someone and then withdraw it to their bank. And so like, they very much<br/>
[[6:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=384s) honed in on that. And I think that's, I think that's a really, really good example of like,<br/>
[[6:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=385s) they very much honed in on that very specific UX without even really caring so much about how<br/>
[[6:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=389s) sexy the UI is. Right. And so with Web3 UX, we have an entirely different set of problems that<br/>
[[6:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=398s) goes very deep just to get to parity with with, with traditional finance and FinTech. And that's,<br/>
[[6:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=406s) so it's like when it comes to like Web3, for example, and especially with Ethereum,<br/>
[[6:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=409s) it's like, okay, we have, we have gas, we have to worry about, we have<br/>
[[6:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=413s) token approvals, we have to worry about, we have multi-chain, which we have to worry about.<br/>
[[6:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=419s) We have bundled transactions, if there's multiple transactions, right? And so luckily,<br/>
[[7:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=425s) all of these things are now, like there are solutions for these, right? Between like 4337<br/>
[[7:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=431s) and 7702, there are ways to implement Paymasters, there are ways to bundle transactions together,<br/>
[[7:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=436s) there's ways to do zaps. Not everyone does all of these things and does it all together. It's like,<br/>
[[7:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=443s) PistachioFi We do all of this, right? We do it all together, all in one go. One thing that<br/>
[[7:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=449s) like we don't do, for example, is like maybe within Web3 gaming, there's this concept of<br/>
[[7:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=453s) session keys. And it's like, oh, okay, if I'm going to have a game, do I then have to sign<br/>
[[7:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=458s) every single transaction for everything that goes, that gets written to the blockchain? It's like,<br/>
[[7:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=462s) no, you just do a session key. You sign once as you sign in, basically, as you're signing into<br/>
[[7:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=467s) the game or app, you sign a session key for that extends for that period of your, your, your gaming session. Right?<br/>
[[7:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=473s) And so that basically absolves away or extracts away that problem as well. So there's a lot that<br/>
[[8:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=480s) it takes for like a Web3 company, again, to get to parity of all these things. There are ways to<br/>
[[8:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=486s) solve it all. It's just a matter of like, does the app creator understand all of these things?<br/>
[[8:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=492s) Are they aware of all of these things? Do they care enough to do all of these things, right?<br/>
[[8:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=496s) Like some of the major apps, or wallets, even like I love, I'm a big Rabby user, they still don't<br/>
[[8:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=503s) have these 7702 implemented. Right. And so there's a lot of these like big players that<br/>
[[8:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=506s) still don't have these, these available UX implementations live and integrated into their apps.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[8:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=515s) I'm curious, Brian, because like, you know, just to reveal some of the background, right,<br/>
[[8:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=521s) when you were working for us, you were like a sales guy. How did you teach yourself about UX<br/>
[[8:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=526s) and product design? I'm glad you know, you've joined the dark side. But it's like, like, what,<br/>
[[8:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=532s) what, what got you into UX?<br/>
[[8:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=533s) there and you know what what made you feel like okay this is something<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[8:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=539s) I can take. Well, I've always<br/>
[[9:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=541s) honestly really loved the product side. Like I think I had like a natural ability to be a sales<br/>
[[9:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=548s) person. Like I love to just chat and create rapport and I think that's very important for<br/>
[[9:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=554s) sales and marketing. But at the end of the day, I really just had a knack for—I think it<br/>
[[9:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=562s) was more of like just a natural inclination to this sort of thing. And then once I realized it<br/>
[[9:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=568s) and I started to do it, it's one of those—it's like the natural calling, right? Like when you find<br/>
[[9:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=574s) something that you really like, you don't really know that you really like it until you're doing<br/>
[[9:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=578s) it and knee deep in it. And then now suddenly I'm spending 12 to 15 hour days working a website<br/>
[[9:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=584s) or whatever it is, right, just because I'm like, I'm obsessed with being able to do this and improve<br/>
[[9:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=592s) it and making it a job. Like I don't know, it's like just a different thing. But also<br/>
[[9:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=592s) like having UX/UI—it was like some courses that I would take and do that. And then a lot of it<br/>
[[9:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=598s) was just trial and error. And I think a big part of it was having my own thing. And I'm sure [Kieren]({{ '/people/kieren-james-lubin/' | relative_url }})<br/>
[[10:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=604s) can—or I mean I think all of you, but both you guys can relate to this—is that once it's yours,<br/>
[[10:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=613s) you know there's a different sort of obsession that comes with it rather than just like working for<br/>
[[10:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=619s) someone. Like, you know, like if you're doing something that kind of—you're kind of going to work<br/>
[[10:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=622s) when you work for someone, it's like, oh okay, I get equity options and this and a paycheck,<br/>
[[10:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=628s) and that's nice. But that's not as much skin in the game as truly owning something and having<br/>
[[10:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=637s) being like aligned of like, okay, if I kill this, like I get monetarily incentivized just because<br/>
[[10:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=642s) I killed it and it's my baby, right? So I think that sort of shines a lot in being like a<br/>
[[10:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=649s) founder and growing your own application. And then it's just like I have like an obsession<br/>
[[10:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=654s) with it, to be honest. Like I have an obsession of talking to users and understand what makes<br/>
[[11:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=660s) it better and just like the perfectionist in me of seeing something wrong and needing to smooth<br/>
[[11:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=666s) it over, right? And so I think all of that has just like aggregated to and led me to where I am<br/>
[[11:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=674s) today.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[11:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=674s) And yeah, I mean, we—one of the benefits of being in the space so long is we've gotten the<br/>
[[11:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=679s) chance to work with some great people and we could always see that you had that sort of<br/>
[[11:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=683s) entrepreneurial spirit. It's interesting that it's come out of this. I'm—I, you know, I think one though<br/>
[[11:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=688s) challenging thing about UX for people that come from pure sort of technical backgrounds is the<br/>
[[11:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=695s) ability to listen when people say, hey, this is wrong or I don't understand this. Like that seems<br/>
[[11:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=701s) to be a big hurdle that, you know, a lot of truly technical people just can't get over.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[11:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=708s) And it comes down to—which I think maybe is—makes it hard sometimes for technical people to get into this as<br/>
[[11:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=715s) well—is that I say like UX is just empathy just like brought to life. Because at the end of the<br/>
[[12:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=723s) day, it's like you very, very much need to just be able to put yourself in your users' shoes<br/>
[[12:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=729s) and to empathize with, oh okay, like this isn't good enough because they're being frustrated,<br/>
[[12:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=734s) which should frustrate you, right? Like if it's going to piss them off, it's going to piss them off—<br/>
[[12:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=739s) should piss you off that it's not good enough. Because like if you don't have that empathy,<br/>
[[12:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=744s) if you don't have that ability to like also be frustrated, then you're not going to care enough<br/>
[[12:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=749s) to fix it, right? It's like you should be pissed if a user is going to be pissed. You should be pissed.<br/>
<br/>
**Kieren:**<br/>
[[12:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=756s) Yeah, 100%. Who do you see your target user as? And I guess, I mean,<br/>
[[12:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=764s) you know, there's like there's full-on normies, there's crypto native,<br/>
[[12:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=769s) there's—but the, you know, absolutely like interesting like age ranges and all that sort<br/>
[[12:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=774s) of thing. Because I think maybe both of us, but you know, it's like it's hard to define exactly<br/>
[[12:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=779s) like the bucket. Like they probably are crypto friendly, but maybe, you know, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[13:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=785s) We will be. Normally we are normie friendly. Like if you want to invite your—your—your—I want to say your<br/>
[[13:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=792s) parents, but your dad's a bit, I think, beyond the rest of us when it comes to being crypto native.<br/>
[[13:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=799s) When it comes to like let's say like siblings and family, I want it to be like friendly enough<br/>
[[13:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=803s) that you can invite these people without fear of throwing them to the wolves of volatility,<br/>
[[13:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=808s) of risk, of perps, of scams, of rug pulls—all these things. And so it's<br/>
[[13:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=814s) designed with all of that in mind. But really my ideal user, my ideal customer,<br/>
[[13:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=820s) is probably between the ages of like 25 to 55 that are crypto inclined, that probably have been in<br/>
[[13:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=829s) crypto for some time, that have large amounts of funds on-chain, that want to be able to not need<br/>
[[13:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=836s) to off-board crypto into the bank, that want to have a sort of high quality self-custodial, high<br/>
[[14:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=844s) security but highly convenient mechanism within their pocket that values convenience, that values<br/>
[[14:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=851s) security, but that also values privacy, and that has the ability then to not let their funds—if<br/>
[[14:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=860s) they're going to risk off into stables, for example—be able to easily earn safe, curated, high<br/>
[[14:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=868s) quality yield that is at least double of what is U.S. Treasuries without being exposed to equities.<br/>
[[14:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=874s) And then being able to spend or transfer that money very quickly. And so that's sort of like,<br/>
[[14:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=879s) through just talking to a lot of people,<br/>
[[14:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=881s) seems to be the very like bread and butter of people that I think would work very well<br/>
[[14:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=886s) of like a customer user base—of people who can at least put five figures into my app, preferably<br/>
[[14:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=893s) at least 50 grand into the six figures, that would also trust Pistachio's security mechanism because<br/>
[[15:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=900s) of the amount of due diligence and effort that we've put into our system to protect our<br/>
[[15:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=906s) users, to trust that as well. But also if you want to like invite your friends, your friends,<br/>
[[15:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=911s) family, to make it easy just to get on-chain, this is the easiest way, right?<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[15:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=918s) So why do you think the UX has been so bad in Web3 for so long?<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[15:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=927s) I think it's a large disconnect of people building<br/>
[[15:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=931s) and people talking to users. Especially a lot of—like I talk to a lot of founders. I love to talk<br/>
[[15:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=937s) to founders. I like—I meet so many people. Like one of the coolest parts about being a founder is just<br/>
[[15:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=943s) sort of like in that natural like BD aspect is just like I meet so many people and like about<br/>
[[15:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=949s) what they're building. And very frequently I'm asked to basically audit people's UX, UIs, just<br/>
[[15:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=957s) give feedback. And I think a big part of what people build is they build because people want<br/>
[[16:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=963s) to build an MVP, they want to build fast, they want to build something. And it's like it's a hard<br/>
[[16:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=967s) chicken-the-egg problem of like, how do I talk to users? I don't have anything for them to use.<br/>
[[16:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=973s) I don't have an MVP if I don't have these. And so people then build in this direction of, okay, well,<br/>
[[16:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=979s) I'm just going to build a product and then I'm going to get users, right? And so realistically<br/>
[[16:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=983s) what they want to do is they should be like building the product, but as you're building it,<br/>
[[16:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=988s) you want to talk to potential users. You want to talk to people who you think this problem is<br/>
[[16:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=995s) solving, right? Because it's not just—you shouldn't just be building an app or like a feature set.<br/>
[[16:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=998s) Again, you need to build to solve for a problem. And so like when you're building<br/>
[[16:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1003s) to solve for that specific problem, you really need to go to your friends and be like—or people—<br/>
[[16:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1007s) I mean, first your friends, because they're just the most likely to give you help. And it's like,<br/>
[[16:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1012s) any of you have this problem? Like find friends who have this problem. If you don't, it's not<br/>
[[16:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1017s) necessarily a red flag, but you do have to keep going out there and find people who have this<br/>
[[17:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1022s) problem. And then if you go out and you don't find people who have this problem, eventually you're not<br/>
[[17:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1027s) solving a problem, right? Like you're creating a solution in search of a problem.<br/>
[[17:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1033s) Actually, like finding people who would be willing to like test out what you're doing and then show<br/>
[[17:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1038s) them the earliest iterations, right? And so figuring out that—of is this confusing? Is this<br/>
[[17:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1044s) good? Is this bad? Is this specific UX really actually solving the core problem<br/>
[[17:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1051s) that we set out to solve? At the end of the day, luckily, I think a lot of builders these days<br/>
[[17:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1056s) set out to create companies specifically because they encountered problems in their<br/>
[[17:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1063s) earlier careers or usages, right, of that. Let's say you work in like a B2B company or<br/>
[[17:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1071s) you're creating—a founder, maybe you're a founder for a company—you're like, dude, this is such a pain<br/>
[[17:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1075s) in my butt, right, that you're—this one like particular thing. They go on to create a company<br/>
[[17:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1079s) that goes to solve that problem, right? It's like they're dogfooding their own pain.<br/>
[[18:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1083s) Same thing with B2C. And kind of like I love to use crypto and be on-chain and love all of these<br/>
[[18:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1089s) different apps and trying all of these things. And that's what led me<br/>
[[18:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1093s) to where I am with creating, like, right? Because I would dogfood all these apps<br/>
[[18:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1098s) essentially and just be like, okay, well, this isn't good enough, this isn't good enough. And so I<br/>
[[18:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1104s) think that that's sort of the main reason that creators or app builders—I think they maybe<br/>
[[18:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1110s) try to create something for maybe to be cool or to add a vanity, even, or potentially to chase<br/>
[[18:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1117s) a trend because they see, ah, this is where all the money's going, right? Like people are chasing perps.<br/>
[[18:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1123s) Like there are how many thousands of different perps companies are there that are trying to<br/>
[[18:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1127s) like go and go out and get money? Also because people, for better or for worse, you know, they try<br/>
[[18:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1132s) to chase that trend because they see that where like the VC money is flowing to. And they say, oh,<br/>
[[18:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1136s) if I can get on that VC train, then I can get the money to build this, right? And like chase that<br/>
[[19:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1141s) trend that maybe that's the hot narrative that everyone's investing in. And so there's like all—<br/>
[[19:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1145s) they're getting pulled in all these different directions instead of going really back to the<br/>
[[19:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1149s) core of what problem do I want to solve?<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[19:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1153s) I mean, my kind of theory and one of the challenges Web3 has had is that, you know, in the<br/>
[[19:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1158s) first phase of Web3, really we're just trying to solve technical problems, right, like make<br/>
[[19:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1163s) it work at all. And the people who did those things kind of succeeded to a sin. And then, but<br/>
[[19:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1172s) those people that can solve like those super hard technical problems are not the kind of<br/>
[[19:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1176s) UX people that can kind of think like, oh, from a user perspective, really, right? They're<br/>
[[19:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1182s) thinking more about,<br/>
[[19:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1183s) okay, how do we solve that technical problem? And that's really where I think the shift has kind of<br/>
[[19:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1187s) happened. And, you know, I think you've caught it at the right time.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[19:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1192s) I think there's a lot more engineers these days too that are more savvy in that way,<br/>
[[19:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1194s) like towards design, like more like<br/>
[[19:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1197s) hybrid engineers who have that back, like back end, front—I mean just full stack, right, who then<br/>
[[20:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1203s) are now also intrigued in design. And this—because maybe they built their own thing<br/>
[[20:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1208s) from scratch and they had—they were forced to, right, as opposed to just like a straight<br/>
[[20:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1213s) back end engineer who's doing these things. One thing—<br/>
<br/>
**Kieren:**<br/>
[[20:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1215s) I'll say I now code again occasionally<br/>
[[20:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1219s) because the AI has gotten so good. And if it has a template, like it's not so good at UX from scratch,<br/>
[[20:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1225s) but if it has something to work from, I'm like, no, just like generate a component like this and<br/>
[[20:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1230s) do this. And it usually gets it right within a couple times. So the iteration cycle is so much<br/>
[[20:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1236s) less painful than it used to be. Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[20:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1239s) I found with my Web 2 startups and my mobile startup<br/>
[[20:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1243s) that, like, one of the reasons, you know, I was like CTO of the first startups and then I switched<br/>
[[20:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1248s) to product because I realized that, like, hey, by turning step three into step one, I could like<br/>
[[20:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1254s) 10x the usage overnight, right? So it's like that, but it's a totally different mode of thinking than,<br/>
[[21:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1261s) oh, how am I going to get the code out the door and get all of those things?<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[21:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1260s) Also, the infrastructure<br/>
[[21:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1266s) really didn't exist for a while. Like I remember vividly, like one time we were at the BlockApps<br/>
[[21:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1272s) office and, Vic, you said in the office, like, like, mobile Web3 sucks. Just—just I—I just—I remember I<br/>
[[21:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1280s) don't even remember that. I just remember you going on about it. And it was true for such a long period<br/>
[[21:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1285s) of time is that the infrastructure needed to basically bring Web3 to mobile didn't exist for<br/>
[[21:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1291s) the longest time. And this last, like, bear cycle of crypto, a lot of VC funding went to infrastructure.<br/>
[[21:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1299s) It's still not good enough, but that's fine,<br/>
[[21:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1302s) all right, always improving. But the fact that a lot of infrastructure now exists that didn't<br/>
[[21:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1309s) exist back then, or even just libraries, right, of people being—of having SDKs that are compatible<br/>
[[21:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1315s) with React Native, or just like native mobile languages to make it easier for developers to<br/>
[[22:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1321s) just take that and go and build and integrate. Because we need that. Like I can't—we can't build<br/>
[[22:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1325s) everything from scratch, dude. Like as much as I would love to have everything in house, especially<br/>
[[22:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1329s) being a mostly bootstrap company, it's like, no, we need the infrastructure, right? And that's what I<br/>
[[22:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1332s) need people to have, like, proper—they need to have like good docs, good SDKs, good APIs, like<br/>
[[22:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1339s) hardened stuff that we can just take and use and that we don't have to like bash our heads against<br/>
[[22:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1345s) the wall trying to integrate it because it doesn't work.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[22:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1348s) I—yeah, I kind of remember that conversation.<br/>
[[22:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1351s) I think one of my frustrations at the time was like talking to some of the Ethereum devs and<br/>
[[22:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1356s) they were like, yeah, we have a mobile solution. We're gonna run a node on your phone. It was like,<br/>
[[22:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1362s) do you know, like, battery life is important to me? I know this is the last of the day.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[22:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1368s) This is where I started, remember?<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[22:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1372s) Yes, you tried to run it on a watch, man.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[22:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1375s) Smartwatch. That was my first project, was seeing if I could get cpp-ethereum running on a smartwatch.<br/>
[[23:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1382s) And I didn't—that. But Geth worked. Geth worked on a smartwatch. And it was because it was so<br/>
[[23:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1388s) early, right, that the chain was quite small. It was kind of just about<br/>
[[23:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1392s) workable. And now there's a thought at the time, well, you know, yeah, we're gonna have like a light<br/>
[[23:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1396s) client thing. There isn't yet, but, you know, we'll get that going. And same thing with on the<br/>
[[23:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1402s) desktop, right, with Mist. You know, Mist—Mist having embedded. Yeah, it was just a thought<br/>
[[23:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1408s) that, yeah, you know, it might be a bit slow, but, you know, we'll optimize it. It'll get 10x, it'll get 100x.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[23:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1414s) Yeah, none of those people have ever built a mobile app before, obviously.<br/>
[[23:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1439s) You're gonna have—<br/>
[[23:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1422s) every router, it will just be like an OS level sort of service.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[23:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1426s) Building a mobile app sucks.<br/>
[[23:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1427s) It's hard. It's really hard.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[23:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1430s) Getting approved by Apple especially. Oh, that's like a—that's like a nightmarish—<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[23:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1435s) I think that was the easy part, dude. That was good. It's like that's hard, but that was the<br/>
[[24:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1440s) easy part. It's like building a Web3 app that's multi-chain on multiple operating systems is just—<br/>
[[24:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1448s) the amount of edge cases that exist is a nightmare.<br/>
[[24:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1452s) That's like been the hardest part. Like our last—like we launched in June, or like May, June, and<br/>
[[24:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1458s) then literally all summer was just like hardening the app and discovering and smoothing over edge case.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[24:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1464s) And I see you've just launched on Android as well. Congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[24:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1470s) Thank you. Publicly at<br/>
[[24:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1471s) least, you know, we've been—we've been like—I'm a big soft launch guy if you can. We're always<br/>
[[24:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1476s) probably soft releasing something ahead of time if you dig hard enough. But yeah,<br/>
[[24:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1482s) so Android took a while, like months longer than Apple, because it's much easier to<br/>
[[24:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1489s) develop on Apple, right? It's like everything's standardized. Everything just works across every<br/>
[[24:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1493s) single device. On Android, it's like, okay, you have to worry about—basically you have to worry about<br/>
[[24:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1499s) like optimizations going back far enough to like Android 12 to cover like 90% of use cases.<br/>
[[25:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1505s) 10% of the world still runs on Android 11 and below, which is almost absurd.<br/>
[[25:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1512s) And if you're doing that, you also have to worry about hardware optimizations, right, to make sure<br/>
[[25:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1516s) that the app itself is lightweight enough to work on, like, very like base level Android devices,<br/>
[[25:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1523s) right, because they cost very low and most of the world has a lot of these just like really cheap<br/>
[[25:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1528s) devices. Okay? So you can't like load the app so much. It has to be optimized for that. And then the<br/>
[[25:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1532s) amount of like different, like screen types, and like getting, like, the edge to edge display to<br/>
[[25:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1537s) work via like React Native Expo was also not working very well.<br/>
[[25:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1542s) And so a lot of people that launch apps on different devices, right, they maybe don't use<br/>
[[25:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1547s) React Native Expo. Maybe they have like native to each device. And so there's not even<br/>
[[25:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1553s) like good libraries that help on Expo for this, like—like Expo just launched, like, edge to edge<br/>
[[26:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1560s) display like two months ago, like—like—like these things still aren't very public. And so my CTO even<br/>
[[26:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1567s) wants to launch a library, like a publicly available<br/>
[[26:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1572s) repo, just to help with all of these—all these hardships that we had to go through firsthand,<br/>
[[26:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1577s) essentially.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[26:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1580s) Yeah, I remember, you know, my last company was a mobile company. To make sure things<br/>
[[26:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1583s) ran on like iOS, we ran it on two devices in the simulator. We had a table of Android devices,<br/>
[[26:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1591s) like, and just to kind of like test all the configurations. But in fact,<br/>
[[26:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1594s) there's probably—<br/>
[[26:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1596s) I don't know, ten thousand, more than ten thousand different—<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[26:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1595s) Like, yeah, I got this—<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[26:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1601s) Yeah, I mean,<br/>
[[26:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1602s) I got a couple over here too. But like, you know, like TVs and tablets and whatever, right? They're<br/>
[[26:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1609s) all different. And they're all—I—I'm really curious, like, you know, when you made that evolution to a<br/>
[[26:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1614s) founder, as you were talking about before, what—what was the biggest challenge that you faced, do<br/>
[[26:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1619s) you think? The biggest challenge—<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[27:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1631s) It evolves over time, right? Like as I level up as a founder,<br/>
[[27:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1632s) the challenges get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and<br/>
[[27:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1634s) bigger in a way. I think in the early days, one, it was getting people to align with my vision.<br/>
[[27:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1640s) It's like I have this vision in my head and I can talk about it, but then there's always a disconnect<br/>
[[27:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1647s) from what someone else's interpretation of my vision is versus what I have in my head. And so<br/>
[[27:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1652s) that's why I learned UX, UI design, was so I can, like, literally just like put it into a Figma<br/>
[[27:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1656s) and show someone and be like, this is what I want, right? Like, this is how I foresee it. And so that<br/>
[[27:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1662s) was the first challenge. And then I got my CTO<br/>
[[27:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1664s) on board because he's like, I love this idea. Let's do it. So then we did that. And then the next<br/>
[[27:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1667s) challenge was the architecture, right? And so then the architectural solution of vendor selection,<br/>
[[27:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1673s) which I was talking to someone early today about—this vendor selection's a nightmare. Like I luckily<br/>
[[27:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1678s) already knew what chain I wanted to work on and what, like, and how I wanted to be like multi-chain.<br/>
[[28:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1684s) So that was good. And then it's like, okay, so now to be like a robust multi-chain application, this is<br/>
[[28:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1689s) pretty cutting edge technology, especially if I want to use like account abstraction and<br/>
[[28:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1694s) smart accounts. Like very few people are sort of working on this, especially in the mobile era.<br/>
[[28:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1699s) And so, like, the infrastructure available to us at the time was fairly limited.<br/>
[[28:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1704s) And then it's like, okay, we have to worry about like key storage and how do we do recovery and<br/>
[[28:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1708s) how do we keep people safe. And like these are all the different vendors. Like for all—every different—<br/>
[[28:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1712s) there's a different decision for a different vendor at each part of the stack. And<br/>
[[28:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1718s) being able to basically understand Web3 deep enough to understand the trade-offs of each<br/>
[[28:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1723s) different vendor, and then be able to basically understand the trade-offs of each different vendor<br/>
[[28:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1724s) and what they bring. And, okay, well, what's the price? Because we're unfunded, right? So I have to<br/>
[[28:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1728s) make sure it works within my realm of my budget, while also being able to make sure it's like<br/>
[[28:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1733s) scalable in the long term if we—if we—if we do go into this thing. And then, how do we do—how do we<br/>
[[28:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1739s) do—do we do things to be modular? Do we do things to go like purely vertical stacked? Does that lock<br/>
[[29:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1744s) us in as a vendor? Do we want to be more modular? And—and then we've had opportunity—we've had<br/>
[[29:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1749s) moments where we've had to just rip vendors out of our stack because they're not performing enough,<br/>
[[29:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1754s) lead enough, you know? And so by removing them and upgrading whatever we had, which sets us<br/>
[[29:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1759s) back in delivery time, right? So which took us a lot longer to build this stuff, especially as like<br/>
[[29:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1766s) literally a two-person team for the longest time. We just hired our second full-time engineer last<br/>
[[29:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1771s) month. But like it's just been me and my CTO for the longest time. And like, thank God that I<br/>
[[29:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1777s) understand like blockchain architecture as deeply as I do, or my CTO would have—it would have been—<br/>
[[29:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1783s) and all of this would have been on him. And it made it much easier being able to share that<br/>
[[29:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1788s) experience.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[29:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1789s) That's awesome. But yeah, it's—it's—as you say, every—every step there's a new challenge.<br/>
[[29:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1796s) But, you know, I think it's also like just kind of being excited. Like you—you work really, really<br/>
[[30:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1802s) hard, as we can see. So, like, I think it's really exciting to hear about where you've gotten to<br/>
[[30:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1808s) with this project and just in general.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[30:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1811s) Thank you. So, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[30:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1812s) So, yeah,<br/>
[[30:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1813s) looking at the time, Brian, so let me just ask you one last question, perhaps.<br/>
[[30:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1820s) When—when are we ready for the normies?<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[30:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1820s) We're already ready for the normies. At least<br/>
[[30:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1826s) Pistachio is, right? We can—we made it so that onboarding is very smooth, very easy. You<br/>
[[30:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1833s) don't have to worry about seed phrases. You don't have to worry about even having your<br/>
[[30:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1837s) phone stolen, right? Like we can recover everything in programmatic ways, in<br/>
[[30:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1843s) secure ways as well, that's not going to get you hacked or thrown to the wolves. And so,<br/>
[[30:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1851s) but at least the next—the next wave of updates that we're going to be doing is going to be really<br/>
[[30:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1856s) cool too, I think. Like it's just like the ability to—essentially the alpha is, like, the ability to<br/>
[[31:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1862s) send bank transfers from an on-chain account, like, to specific—change—like, accounts all over the<br/>
[[31:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1868s) world for very, very cheap. So, like, stuff like that is going to be really cool because that solves<br/>
[[31:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1873s) the real pain, right? It's like this idea of going back to before, literally what I've been talking<br/>
[[31:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1878s) about. Like crypto—one. And even to tie it all in for the "Is better Web3 UX the key to<br/>
[[31:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1886s) mainstream adoption?" And I don't think it is, right? It's like better UX is the key to any<br/>
[[31:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1892s) app adoption, right? It's why we've seen Robinhood or whatever get big. But there needs to<br/>
[[31:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1898s) be a fundamental problem and fundamental pain being solved at the end of the day.<br/>
[[31:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1903s) So, like, I said before, like the, hey, it's okay to send an on-chain transaction,<br/>
[[31:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1904s) but right now if I'm not able to send an on-chain transaction—it's okay to send an on-chain<br/>
[[31:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1904s) transaction because it's my ability—my ability to send an on-chain transaction<br/>
[[31:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1906s) and have it arrive as an ACH transfer or Spay transfer from the US to Mexico for only a dollar—<br/>
[[31:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1914s) like, that's—that's significant pain being solved. Because, like, most common applications right now<br/>
[[32:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1920s) that do it are, let's say, like Dollar App or Felix. And they do it for like a three dollar flat fee,<br/>
[[32:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1924s) which is still pretty expensive for—considering if you want to send money to someone. If you only want to send in small amounts, right, it's like a hundred dollars a month or so,<br/>
[[32:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1933s) that's a three percent fee that's quite high. And so we can basically do it in a way with like no limits, no caps.<br/>
[[32:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1940s) You can send fifty thousand dollars for a dollar if you want to do it like with banking rails, or if you want to just keep it on-chain and keep it in Pistachio.<br/>
[[32:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1949s) Right. It's free, unlimited, as we all know, how you can like send money in crypto land.<br/>
[[32:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1955s) Right? You can send a million dollars in a second for only a few cents.<br/>
[[32:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1959s) And on Pistachio, every—all the peer to peer transactions are free.<br/>
[[32:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1962s) So I think we're ready for normies right now, but it's just about increasing the amount of—increasing the use cases within the app to solve very distinct pains.<br/>
[[32:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1977s) Painful, expensive pains. That's the way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[33:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1983s) OK, well, thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[33:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1984s) Thank you guys for having me.<br/>
[[33:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1987s) Yeah, I know you got to run.<br/>
<br/>
**Kieren:**<br/>
[[33:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1990s) I hope that at least some of us will be at some of the international events.<br/>
[[33:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1995s) Maybe we can catch up there.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[33:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1996s) Yeah, perfect.<br/>
[[33:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=1997s) Please, if you guys are going to eat for that time in Brazil or DevConnect, I'll be at both of them.<br/>
<br/>
**Victor:**<br/>
[[33:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=2001s) So we will definitely be there. Look forward to seeing you in person.<br/>
[[33:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=2005s) And I want to see your talk. Share us details about your talk, man.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[33:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=2009s) Yeah, absolutely. Will do. Take care.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[33:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=2012s) OK, thanks so much.<br/>
<br/>
**Brian:**<br/>
[[33:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=2013s) Thanks. It's great to meet you, Bob.<br/>
<br/>
**Bob:**<br/>
[[33:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iPxnzJEa2A&t=2016s) You too. Cheers.<br/>
